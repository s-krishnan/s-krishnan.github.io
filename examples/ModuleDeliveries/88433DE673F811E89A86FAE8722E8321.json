The nature of these problems thereby demands a diverse and complex skill set from those working directly to engage with them. Policy analysts need to be able to not only understand the requirements of effective and efficient analysis of complex problems, but also know how such insight can be operationalised into practical process design, procurement, execution, quality assurance, and communication of such analytical processes - often attempting to deploy rigorous techniques in far from ideal situations and environments.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile policy challenges faced will be diverse in their context and specialist requirements, this course seeks to impart a systematic and widely applicable approach to underpin their analysis. It contends that there is a subset of analytic methods likely to be useful in resolving a wide range of policy issues. This approach is, however, not readily encountered in practice. Constrained by time, limited resources and other working pressures, analysts often default to selecting analytic methods on grounds of their familiarity rather than suitability to the task at hand. In addition, it is not uncommon for analysts to have been conditioned throughout their educational and professional personal histories to affiliate themselves with either quantitative or qualitative expertise. Such biases within analytical enquiry fundamentally (and regrettably) put at risk the potential for further useful analytical insights to contribute to the resolution of a policy issue. Rather than separately engage quantitative and qualitative techniques, this course is grounded in the view that analysis for policy instead requires multi- methodological practice that simultaneously combines their relative contributions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe course introduces a diverse range of analytical methods for informing public decisions. Over 30 different methods are presented to provide students with an overview of the landscape of analytic practice for policy. These cover analytic contributions across the spectrum of public problem-solving activities: defining problem requirements; understanding the system; exploring options; analysing risk; informing action; and communicating insight. Traditionally these methods would be encountered and grouped under different sectoral or disciplinary labels, including &lsquo;decision analysis&rsquo;, &lsquo;strategy development&rsquo;, &lsquo;operational research&rsquo;, &lsquo;problem structuring&rsquo;, &lsquo;foresight &amp; futures&rsquo;, &lsquo;research design&rsquo;, &lsquo;evaluation&rsquo;, &lsquo;design thinking&rsquo;, &lsquo;systems analysis&rsquo;, &lsquo;data science&rsquo;, and &lsquo;coding&rsquo;. The course will explain historical end emerging connections between these fields, and introduce all methods with a single, overarching analytic practice for policy framework.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis course is intended to support students on the UCL STEaPP Masters of Public Administration (MPA) programmes explore the practical ways by which evidence and scientific analysis can be generated and used to inform policy development and pubic decision- making. It is also intended for UCL postgraduates who have an in interest in analytic practice for public policy.&nbsp;</p>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"Restricted to UCL STEaPP MPA students only (all MPA routes)","ModuleInstanceSubjectCollection":"","ModuleDeliveryCollection":{"ModuleDelivery":[{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"BAFD80780F5E11E9A4DD885EDBEA4910","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T2","PeriodTitle":"Term 2"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"ISTEE12","Name":"Ine Jean-Paula Steenmans","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"35","NumberOfStudents":"47","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}},{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"8852CAF473F811E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T1","PeriodTitle":"Term 1"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"ISTEE12","Name":"Ine Jean-Paula Steenmans","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"35","NumberOfStudents":"35","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}}]}}}}}
