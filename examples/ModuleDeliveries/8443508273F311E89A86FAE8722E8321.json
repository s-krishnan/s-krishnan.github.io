The module takes a broad comparative approach to the archaeology of North, Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean, from c. 1500-500 BC (depending on the region) to the European colonial period. It will cover demographic processes of sedentary societies, the development and variations of socio-political complexity in different regions of the continent, and long-distance contact between pre-Columbian societies of the Americas. Topics for discussion are likely to include material culture, art and technology; links between environmental dimensions of subsistence systems, climate change, and landscape history; variability in socio-political organisation in the late Holocene Americas; the relevance of centralization, bureaucratic control, militarism, and writing systems in complex, stratified societies of the Americas; relationships between archaeological reconstruction, linguistic and ethnographic evidence, and ethnohistorical accounts; and the role of archaeological evidence in cultural heritage and contemporary identity construction.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"","ModuleInstanceSubjectCollection":"","ModuleDeliveryCollection":{"ModuleDelivery":{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"8451A03873F311E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T2","PeriodTitle":"Term 2"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"MARRO12","Name":"Manuel Arroyo-Kalin","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"8","NumberOfStudents":"8","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}}}}}}}
