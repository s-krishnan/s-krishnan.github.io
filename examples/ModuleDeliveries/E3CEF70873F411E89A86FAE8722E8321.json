Through theoretical investigations and selected case studies, we will explore the nature and scope of educational successes and challenges (and responses to them) &ndash; philosophical, organisational, political and pedagogical. In this regard, one of the main aims of the course will be to explore historical trajectories leading to today&rsquo;s complex and contradictory educational scenario in the Muslim contexts. Experts will facilitate discussion on national and regional case studies to illuminate the interconnected areas of concern and issues and challenges to appreciate diversity of education in Muslim communities. A significant strength of the module is wide range of experiences students bring to it. It allows us to bring together theory and practice and explore contests over knowledge, distribution of cultural capital and functionalisation of institutions historically and in specific contemporary contexts. The course will elucidate the state of education and seek understanding and explanation of such educational provision in the light of global declarations such as Education For All (Dakar 2000, Jomtien 1990) and the Sustaianble Development Goals. Modes of engagements in Muslim societies with these international agreements and discourses will be explored. Consequently, the module will critically investigate current global efforts and approaches to improve educational provision. In this regard, the meanings of notions such as modernity, alterity, tradition and identity will be investigated with a view to understand their complexities and on-going contestation. Education in societies of Muslims has a long tradition dating back to the earliest centuries of their history. During this period, the world has witnessed the rise and fall of various Muslim cultures and civilisations; robust and fragile periods of learning and technological advances; and eras of political and economic domination and subjugation. This tradition will be approached with a view to understand its continued appeal among Muslims and with an open minded enquiry into the contributions it can make to wider educational and intellectual concerns of our times. Overall, this course will be useful for students interested in the history of ideas, educational change, contemporary issues in Muslim contexts and the questions of power and pedagogy.</p>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"","ModuleInstanceSubjectCollection":"","ModuleDeliveryCollection":{"ModuleDelivery":[{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"E3F2727873F411E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T2","PeriodTitle":"Term 2"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"FPANJ89","Name":"Farid Panjwani","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"30","NumberOfStudents":"30","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}},{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"E3DD290473F411E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T2","PeriodTitle":"Term 2"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"FPANJ89","Name":"Farid Panjwani","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"0","NumberOfStudents":"0","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}}]}}}}}
