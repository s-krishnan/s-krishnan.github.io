It will consider the purposes of research knowledge; the variable and shifting status of &lsquo;evidence&rsquo;; the disciplinary, conceptual and political locations of research, underlying epistemological questions about the knowledge claims produced by research and the particular challenges raised by undertaking research in low income and complex contexts. The module will develop students&rsquo; capacities to read as well as engage in education and international development research. Students will have the opportunity to explore a range of research approaches and methods. They will be able to look in more detail at sourcing, generating and analysing specific kinds of existing data and new research content. These will include, interviews, policy and media documents, observations, ethnography, dialogue and conceptual analysis, questionnaires and numeric data. Students will be invited to explore the sorts of questions that might be asked, and answered, by educational and international development research. We will think about the implications of these questions for designing research as well as engaging with, or even influencing policy and practice. The role of the researcher, her/his relationship with the researched, and the ethical dimensions of this will be key considerations.</p>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"Module offered to Education and International Development Cluster students only.","ModuleInstanceSubjectCollection":"","ModuleDeliveryCollection":{"ModuleDelivery":{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"B5B4EC37FBE24698B2081A35B0C21AA7","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T1","PeriodTitle":"Term 1"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"EPEVS62","Name":"Elaine Pevsner","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"30","NumberOfStudents":"30","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}}}}}}}
