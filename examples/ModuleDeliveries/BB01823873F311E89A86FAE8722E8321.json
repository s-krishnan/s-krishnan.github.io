This process will involve significant hands-on modelling, and the module will cover: linear programming (LP), single/multi-objective optimisation, Technology policy and diffusion, and hands on training on small LP-based optimisation model, LEAP and OSeMOSYS energy systems models. This is one of the advanced optional modules in the MSc in Economics and Policy of Energy and the Environment. Building from the core module (BENV0012: Introduction to Modelling, Methods and Scenarios), it will enable students to develop expert skills in the analysis and critically in the use of key energy modelling approaches. With advanced material presented in the first three lectures, the remaining 7 lectures will form a hands-on model tutorial. At the end of this course students should be able to:</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&bull;<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Fully critique and evaluate alternate energy-economic modelling approaches</div>\n<div>\n\t&bull;<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Understand the potential application of energy-economic models in a range of quantitative and analytical research questions</div>\n<div>\n\t&bull;<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Run, analyse and evaluate policy issues using simple energy modelling frameworks</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"This module builds on BENV0012: Introduction to Modelling, Methods and Scenarios.
