The course addresses issues of urban change on the basis of a critical understanding of relevant theories and concepts from urban sociology, urban and regional economics, the urban environment and ecology, and urban politics. Students are encouraged to develop a sensitive understanding of the social, economic, environmental and political contexts and processes which shape and influence planning issues and policies. The module is taught in 4 blocks, each comprising 5 weeks of 2-hour lectures:&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t1. Urban Sociology: this part focuses on the demographic and social changes affecting European cities, the theories that have been developed to understand the linkages between social and spatial change, and the policies which have been designed to address various urban socio-economic problems. An important theme is the effect of economic and social restructuring on patterns of social and spatial inequalities and segregation in cities.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t2. Urban and Regional Economics: this part is concerned with economic processes that transform cities and regions, and the different theoretical approaches that have been developed to explain these.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t3. Urban Environment: this part considers what environments we are planning for and why. It examines how understandings of ecology have transformed into approaches to the environment. It looks at how urban environments and people are involved in the creation of the ecologies we see today and how these are influenced by governmental decisions, as well as local activism.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t4. Urban politics: this part aims to introduce key analytical concepts and theories of urban politics.&nbsp; We will consider key debates and challenges for urban governance, including local government and inter-scalar relations, the politics of knowledge, the politics of difference, urban theory and the post-colonial challenge.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"Only available to MPlan City Planning, MSc International Planning and MSc Spatial Planning.","ModuleInstanceSubjectCollection":"","ModuleDeliveryCollection":{"ModuleDelivery":{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"D984BF8673F311E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T1/2","PeriodTitle":"Terms 1 and 2"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"CMCOL44","Name":"Claire Colomb","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"89","NumberOfStudents":"89","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}}}}}}}
