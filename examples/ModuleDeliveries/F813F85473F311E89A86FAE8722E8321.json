Run in partnership with the British Film Institute (BFI), it comprises weekly seminars and practical workshops bridged by online tasks, interactions, readings and reflections on Moodle. A portfolio of digital media texts will be made culminating in a final short film made in small groups. At the end of the module students will be assessed through a written commentary reflecting critically on the creative processes in which they have participated over the preceding weeks. It is suitable for teachers, youth-workers and students interested in engaging with the skills and dispositions associated with new digital literacies and multimodal practices in educational environments. It encourages participants, not only to develop skills and techniques with the tools of production, but also to experiment with the art and craft of film-making and editing. Of equal importance will be theoretical discussion on the production of popular cultural artefacts and the contexts in which these texts circulate. [The module is designed for beginners and those wishing to develop existing basic skills. We use equipment that schools may have at their disposal in terms of creative production &nbsp;Please note that the module is not designed to provide learners with a professional qualification in film-making]. </span></p>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"This module is only available to students on MA Digital Media: Education.
