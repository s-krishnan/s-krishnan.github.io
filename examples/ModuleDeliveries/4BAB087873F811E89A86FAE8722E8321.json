The course concentrates on building a coherent model, based on an analysis of three different markets (the goods market, the financial markets and the labour market), which can then be used to addresssome of the most important questions facing economic policy makers and to explain both past and future economic events. The major macroeconomic event of the last ferw years is the on-going crisis afflicting the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnderstanding and analysing this crisis (the so-called &#39;Lesser Depression&#39;) and the policy responses which have (and haven&#39;t) accompanied it is a major part of the course.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile &#39;Introduction to Macroeconomis&#39; can be taken as a stand-alone course, it also provides the necessary foundation for the level 2 unit, &#39;European Macroeconomics&#39; and together these 2 units provide a solid background for more advanced studies in macroeconomics.</p>\n<p>\n\tAims and objectives</p>\n<p>\n\t1. To build a coherent short-and medium-run model of the Macroeconomy.</p>\n<p>\n\t2. To show how this coherent modelling framework can be utilised to inform macroeconomic policy debate in the European and global Economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t3. To understand the causes and consequences of the policy response to it.&nbsp; A working knowledge of contemporary short-and medium-run macroeconomic theory.</p>\n<p>\n\t4. The ability to apply tools of macroeconomic theory to actual economic phenomena, such as the recent global economic crises.</p>\n<p>\n\t5. Teh foundation necessary to pursue further study in macroeconomics and to access a range of macroeconomic publications.</p>\n<p>\n\t6. The knowledge and confidence to access and interpret a range of macroeconomic data.</p>\n<p>\n\t7.
