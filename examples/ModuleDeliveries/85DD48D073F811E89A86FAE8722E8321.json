Science and technology have been important forces behind both positive and negative development trends. At a time when global annual spending on research and development exceeds a trillion dollars, more attention is being paid to how new scientific breakthroughs and technological innovations can be more impactful in solving some of our challenging global problems, especially in poorer parts of the world. This Module explores the following themes: multiple narratives and conceptual underpinnings of innovation and development; emerging scientific and technological trends and their relevance for development; the role of innovation systems in sectoral, national and global development; public sector capabilities for science, technology and innovation in developing countries; technological learning, international cooperation and other models for science, technology, innovation and development; managing technological risk; political economy, institutional and human capacity contexts for STI and development. Throughout the Module, students will be able to interrogate and make sense of some of the frameworks and approaches they learnt in Term 1 and other readings in terms of their relevance and application to addressing complex development challenges.</p>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"","ModuleInstanceSubjectCollection":{"ModuleInstanceSubject":["Engineering for International Development","Innovation and Enterprise","Public Policy and Administration","Technology"]},"ModuleDeliveryCollection":{"ModuleDelivery":[{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"86032DD473F811E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T2","PeriodTitle":"Term 2"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"YMULU57","Name":"Yacob Mulugetta","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"20","NumberOfStudents":"20","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}},{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"85EC7ABC73F811E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Undergraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T2","PeriodTitle":"Term 2"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L6","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 6"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"YMULU57","Name":"Yacob Mulugetta","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"10","NumberOfStudents":"10","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}}]}}}}}
