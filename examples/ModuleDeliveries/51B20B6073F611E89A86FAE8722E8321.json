Lectures will include overviews of growth, genetics, genomics, gene regulation, phylogenetics, pathogenicity, antibiotic therapy and antibiotic resistance and are designed to provide a level of background knowledge which enables and encourages students to access the current scientific literature. Lab practical sessions will investigate phase variation, biofilm formation, interference with intercellular communication and bacterial conjugation. The module does not seek to be an all-encompassing introduction to bacteriology nor does it seek to describe detailed molecular mechanisms; rather, the aim is to illustrate some broad concepts key to understanding bacterial adaptation and pathogenicity.</p>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"This module is only available to students on the MSc Infection and Immunity.","ModuleInstanceSubjectCollection":{"ModuleInstanceSubject":"Immunology and Infection"},"ModuleDeliveryCollection":{"ModuleDelivery":{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"51C0834873F611E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T1","PeriodTitle":"Term 1"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"EALLA90","Name":"Elaine Allan","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"25","NumberOfStudents":"25","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}}}}}}}
