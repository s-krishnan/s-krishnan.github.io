The course also builds on fundamental concepts of geochemistry and mineralogy to explain phase behaviour in high temperature systems, and dynamic processes which can, for example, lead to formation of primary igneous ore bodies. Integral practical classes will use both hand specimens and optical mineralogy to understand diagnostic textures - which are used to identify and classify igneous rocks.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy the end of this module students should:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tknow the terminology applied to important families of igneous rocks;</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\trecognize and identify igneous rocks, and their constituent minerals;</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tbe able to provide a petrographic description of igneous rocks, their mineral compositions and textures;</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tunderstand the processes by which igneous rocks are formed;</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tbe able to describe the tectonic settings in which igneous rocks occur including a preliminary assessment of volcanic hazard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\tGEOL0001 Earth Materials is a prerequisite.
