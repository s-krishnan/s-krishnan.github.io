The freedom and autonomy that had characterised the Classical period was no longer viable, and instead there emerged a world of cities subjected to royal power. The reality, however, was a great deal more complex. The Hellenistic period was one in which cities flourished, and the model of the Greek city spread far and wide throughout the world conquered by Alexander the Great and ruled by his Successors. Alexander, paradoxically, `imposed¿ democracy on the cities that he liberated. Demokratia, autonomia (using your own laws) and eleutheria (freedom) continued to be of crucial importance, but such privileges had to be negotiated between king and city. So what were Hellenistic cities like? What was the difference between a `subject city¿ and one that was `free and autonomous¿? Were cities ever free from the demands of kings: taxation, garrison, restructuring of boundaries? The world of cities certainly became more interconnected. Just one example of this is the institution of `foreign¿ judges, men invited to resolve disputes in cities other than their own, a development documented almost entirely through inscriptions.\n\nThis course will take a thematic approach, using in particular the very rich documentation from Asia Minor, where the conflicts between kings often resulted in shifting allegiances. We will analyse the language of epigraphic documents, the most immediate source of evidence for this period, but we will also test the reality of civic developments against Aristotle¿s  theoretical work on the Greek City, the Politics, written at the very beginning of the Hellenistic period.","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"","ModuleInstanceSubjectCollection":"","ModuleDeliveryCollection":{"ModuleDelivery":[{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"CF286FB873F511E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Undergraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T2","PeriodTitle":"Term 2"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L6","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 6"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"RCVAN78","Name":"Hendrika Christina Van Bremen","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"15","NumberOfStudents":"15","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}},{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"CF1252B473F511E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Undergraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T1","PeriodTitle":"Term 1"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L6","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 6"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"RCVAN78","Name":"Hendrika Christina Van Bremen","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"","NumberOfStudents":"15","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}}]}}}}}
