The overall aims are to familiarize students with the theories, tools and computing technologies that are currently used in humanities research and teaching; to provide a basis for making informed choices in the design, management and use of digital resources in the humanities; to promote understanding of the areas where access, manipulation and analysis of digital resources can benefit research and teaching in the humanities. By the end of the course students will be able to identify and evaluate Web-based and other sources in electronic form for humanities research and teaching; use tools to create electronic resources as transcriptions and digital images, and understand the benefits and implications of these methodologies; discuss the social implications of digital humanities work; assess the advantages and disadvantages of different delivery and publishing methods for electronic resources; understand how computers can be used for a range of research and teaching applications in the humanities; understand the principles and uses of text manipulation programs; and evaluate electronic scholarly publications in hypertextual form. The module will be taught via lectures and practical classes. Coursework will include a critical review essay and the design of a digital humanities project prototype.</p>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"This module is only available to UCL Qatar students","ModuleInstanceSubjectCollection":"","ModuleDeliveryCollection":{"ModuleDelivery":[{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"9FFB73E073F811E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T2","PeriodTitle":"Term 2"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"SAHMD15","Name":"Sumayya Ahmed","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"30","NumberOfStudents":"30","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}},{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"9C3927661CA911E988A0A0FA89B3C12B","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T3","PeriodTitle":"Term 3"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"MDOBR21","Name":"Milena Petrova Dobreva","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"30","NumberOfStudents":"30","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}}]}}}}}
