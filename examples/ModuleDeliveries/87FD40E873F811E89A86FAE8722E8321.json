Through experience-based learning that runs over terms 2 and 3 and the summer, students will integrate, apply and deepen the knowledge and skills acquired during the MPA curriculum. Each MPA Group will work with a partner organization that has a genuine need to solve a particular policy challenge. The MPA Group will work with the partner to understand the challenge; develop a work plan that includes problem definition and framing; explore and assess options relevant to the problem context; and deliver a final product that meets the partner&rsquo;s needs and expectations. The MPA group project will run for about nine months (equivalent to an individual research thesis in an academic Masters programme). At least one UCL STEaPP faculty member will support each group. The groups will usually be multidisciplinary and comprise a balance of students with policy/social science and natural science/engineering backgrounds. The groups will ideally comprise 4 or 5 students. Over the course of the project, students will sharpen their capability in engaging with team work, designing projects, strengthen their data collection and analysis skills, hone their critical thinking, develop their written and oral communication, and develop an appreciation of the art of presenting evidence-based knowledge products that address real needs.</p>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"Restricted to UCL STEaPP MPA students (all routes)","ModuleInstanceSubjectCollection":"","ModuleDeliveryCollection":{"ModuleDelivery":{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"880C200473F811E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T2/3","PeriodTitle":"Terms 2 and 3"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"DJHOR80","Name":"David Hornsby","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"35","NumberOfStudents":"35","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}}}}}}}
