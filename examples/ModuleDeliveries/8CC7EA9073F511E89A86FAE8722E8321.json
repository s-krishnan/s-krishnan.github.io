It encompasses readings and discussions centred around theories related to the materiality and the immaterial, makers and their tools, the workings of collections, including questions of conservation, and the notions of time and archive. For the most part, classes will begin with a lecture followed by a discussion. In the first part of the class, students will be introduced to theoretical underpinnings and case studies related to the main topic of the class. During the second part, students will try to apply these theories to one exemplary case study of art production, curating or conservation across the centuries. How is theory performed? How is it entangled with practice? How can we theorise practice or develop a practical aesthetic?</div>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"This module is available to second year undergraduate students taking BA History of Art or BA History of Art and Material Studies.
