This year, we will focus on the drama of Euripides. Apart from the first two hours devoted to a general introduction to the poet and his text, the course will be organised as a seminar, where we approach the problems of Greek tragedy and the play through a close collaborative reading, in Greek, of Euripides&#39; text. All participants should read the assigned text in Greek (about 150 lines per two-hour session) in preparation for each class.&nbsp; Also, a selection of secondary reading has been assigned each week to aid discussion: participants are asked to get through these selections as well.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tThis year, we will focus on the Bacchae. Topics considered will include style, interpretation, textual transmission, dramaturgy, the revenge-theme and the play&#39;s connection to other, earlier dramatic and nondramatic versions of the story, intertextuality, staging, metre, and social, political and religious context. For preparation, see the Oxford commentary by E. R. Dodds (still in print).<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>Skills: </strong>Improved knowledge of tragedy, its contexts and the ancient Greek language; insight into a variety of important themes connected with Greek drama and its contexts, and the ability to carry out original research on these questions. Students will also practice researching a topic of their choice in a mature and independent way, and will learn the basic techniques of academic research, as well as how to express their findings well and coherently in writing.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>Module texts: </strong>Euripides, Bacchae, ed. by E.R.
