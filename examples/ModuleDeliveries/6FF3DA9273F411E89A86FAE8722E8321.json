The first 5 weeks of the course will focus on mathematical logic, including: propositional logic, first-order logic, proof by induction and modal logic. The second 5 weeks will focus on fundamentals of computation, automata and language theory.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>Requisites:</strong><br />\n\tIn order to be eligible to select this module, a student must Â¿be registered on a programme for which it is a formally-approved option or elective choice AND must have A-level Mathematics (or equivalent).</p>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"This module is restricted to students registered on:\nBSc Computer Science\nMEng Computer Science \nMEng Mathematical Computation","ModuleInstanceSubjectCollection":{"ModuleInstanceSubject":"Computer Science"},"ModuleDeliveryCollection":{"ModuleDelivery":{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"7001D82273F411E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Undergraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T1","PeriodTitle":"Term 1"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L4","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 4"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"JBROT05","Name":"James Brotherston","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"173","NumberOfStudents":"173","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}}}}}}}
