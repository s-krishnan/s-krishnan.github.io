It is designed for Year 3 iBSc students. You will conduct experiments designed to test a particular hypothesis that you have developed. You will develop the experimental research protocol, collect amples, perform PCR amplification of 16s rRNA gene regions and analyse the NGS results using high performance computing. After completing the practical work, you will write a short dissertation. For this you will need to put your findings into a broader context and review the relevant literature.</p>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"Available for iBSc students in Year 3, especially for iBSc students interested in a research project related to the Mathematics, Computers and Medicine iBSc. May be appropriate for some BSc Biomedical Sciences students.
