The module is comprised of two parts. In Sessions 1-4, students will explore how to engage with existing evaluations of clinical interventions. We will introduce students to the theories of evidence-based practice and practice-based evidence and how to find and critically review evaluations of clinical interventions. In Sessions 5-8, students will explore how to generate evaluations of their own clinical interventions. We will examine methodological approaches to conducting and analysing evaluations of clinical interventions, focussing on routine outcome monitoring in CAMHS. Throughout, we will focus on considering alternative perspectives on the strengths and limitations of evaluations of clinical interventions. The focus will be on understanding the key principles and practicalities of evaluating clinical interventions and how to apply this understanding to the types of evaluations students may be conducting during their CAMHS placements.</p>\n","ModuleInstanceRestriction":"This module can only be taken by students registered on a relevant Masters programme delivered by the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families.","ModuleInstanceSubjectCollection":"","ModuleDeliveryCollection":{"ModuleDelivery":{"ModuleDeliveryIdentifier":"D7F527C473F711E89A86FAE8722E8321","LevelOfStudy":"Postgraduate","ModuleDeliveryPeriod":{"PeriodCode":"T3","PeriodTitle":"Term 3"},"AcademicLevel":{"AcademicLevelCode":"L7","AcademicLevelTitle":"FHEQ Level 7"},"ModuleDeliveryType":"","ModeOfStudy":"Face-to-face","ModuleDeliveryTutor":{"PersonIdentifier":"JCHIL05","Name":"Julian Hampton Childs","Email":""},"PreviousYearStudentCount":"14","NumberOfStudents":"14","ModuleDeliveryLocation":{"LocationIdentifier":"","LocationName":""},"ModuleDeliveryAssessment":{"AssessmentGroupCollection":{"@DefaultAssessmentGroup":"NULL","AssessmentGroup":[{"AssessmentGroupCode":"NULL","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}},{"AssessmentGroupCode":"A","AssessmentGroupName":"","AssessmentComponentList":{"AssessmentComponent":[{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework three","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"15"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework two (1,800 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"35"},{"AssessmentComponentTitle":"Coursework one (3,000 words)","AssessmentComponentWeightPercentage":"50"}]}}]}}}}}}}}
