This module explores the history of evolution as an idea, covering topics from the eighteenth century to the present. Yes, we will explore science: evolutionary biology has evolved and we&rsquo;ll follow some of those changes. But there is so much more. London has been a key centre in the development of evolutionary studies. Darwin developed key ideas here. So did his predecessors, and many successors. We&rsquo;ll visit locations such as Down House (Darwin&rsquo;s family home), The Grant Museum of Zoology, The Natural History Museum, The Linnean Society and Oxford Museum of Natural History. We&rsquo;ll explore episodes as diverse as (a) dinosaurs and deep time, (b) social Darwinism and corporate capitalism, (c) eugenics, (d) the clash in religion between fundamentalism and modernity, and (e) changing views of what it means to be human. We also explore the idea of hero worship and commemoration: for example, why does Darwin receive so much credit, and why is he buried in Westminster Abbey?

It seeks to integrate broad historical themes and contexts into this survey.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a science module, this course introduces students to some of the main arguments in evolutionary studies over the past 150 years.

One theme of this module is that location matters. It makes a difference.&nbsp;</p>",

This course equips students with the requisite foundational knowledge and skills for effective management in such public sector and non-profit contexts.

Consequently, motivations to lower carbon-emissions have elevated. To ensure change is achieved on a global scale a multinational agreement was confirmed in 2015 at the Paris climate conference whereby 195 countries agreed a legally binding global climate deal, the first of its kind. Advancements in the field of electrochemical engineering and the infrastructure that will subsequently facilitate such changes are essential in order to reduce dependencies upon traditional carbon-intensive technologies. For instance, battery technology for use in automotive applications will require a robust charging network in order to prevent energy shortages and power blackouts. This course will provide insight into each stage of this process, from the chemistry and manufacture of new materials to the organisation of the grid and the redesigning of our metropolitan infrastructure. These stages will subsequently shape and dictate the future of our cities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWeek One</p>\n<p>\n\t&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Electrochemical devices: basics of electrochemistry and prominent devices&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:72.0pt;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWeek Two</p>\n<p>\n\t&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The safe and reliable application of low-carbon technologies: automotive vehicles and housing</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:72.0pt;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWeek Three</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application of these new technologies and their effect on the built environment&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThis module has three key aims: firstly to expose the audience to the essential knowledge of low-carbon energy technologies; secondly, to explore the application of these technologies; and thirdly to envisage how infrastructure will need to be reconceptualised in order to operate efficaciously in the future.</p>",

In order to meet the targets of such agreements, significant breakthroughs must be made in key technologies such as lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells. Breakthroughs will require multidisciplinary approaches from the work of fundamental scientist in the creation of new chemistries, to the applied work of engineers in materials scale up and fabrication, to the economic and policy regulations and guidance that will be required to facilitate such change. However, although significant research is being undertaken in both academic and industrial environments education on such devices remains limited. This course will build upon the teachings of the &lsquo;Energy and future cities&rsquo; module in term one, exposing the audience to a detailed description of the fundamental mechanisms that drive electrochemical devices and how these devices are fabricated and implemented into real-word products answering questions such as: what is a battery?

           "ModuleInstanceDescription": "<p>\n\t<strong>Module Overview</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThis module will enable participants to develop understanding and experience of comprehensive literature reviews and how to conduct their own review addressing key issues in health professions education.&nbsp; In particular, it will focus on:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tIdentifying a gap in the existing health professions education literature</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tFraming an appropriate research question</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSelecting and using methodological approaches when reviewing literature</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSynthesising literature in order to answer the research question.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Aims</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThis module introduces students to important principles of, and approaches to, reviewing the literature in clinical education. The module is particularly designed to support students undertaking the MSc in Health Professions Education Report &ndash; an extended piece of writing worth 60 M-level credits and based on secondary/desk-based research. However, other students will also find the module useful, not least MSc in Health Professions Education students undertaking the Dissertation, which requires a review of literature as well as empirical research.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Module Learning Outcomes</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOn this module you will develop knowledge, skills and understanding that will enable you to:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tDemonstrate a sound knowledge of how to review health professions education literature</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tCompare and contrast various approaches to reviewing the literature</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tFormulate a research question that addresses an evidence gap in the health professions literature</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tDesign and implement a comprehensive search strategy to identify relevant literature</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tAnalyse a range of methodological approaches within health professions education research</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tCritically examine the literature using an appropriate technique and tool</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tDescribe key strategies to synthesise multiple forms of literature</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tArticulate key theoretical issues underpinning literature reviews in health professions education</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Mode of Delivery</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThis blended module will be delivered both face-to-face and through UCL&rsquo;s Virtual Learning Environment (Moodle). This approach combines educational methods that encourage discussion, debate, self-directed learning, reflection on personal experience, critical thinking and access to extensive online resources. This will enable you to engage in collaborative learning and to be in regular contact with module tutors for a high level of academic support.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis course will be facilitated by UCL teaching staff with regular opportunities to provide support and feedback on teaching delivery.</p>\n<p>\n\tParticipants will also complete a written piece of work which describes conducting a literature review looking at a proposed topic of your choice in clinical education or health-related educational research.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>",
