				"ModuleInstanceDescription": "<p>\n\tThe purpose of PHAY 0012 is to learn about the clinical importance of the formulation sciences and pharmaceutical processing.&nbsp; Clinically registered medicines will be used to exemplify concepts. To have impact, the formulation sciences requires knowledge of the clinical end point.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tPharmaceutical Biotechnology is covered during semester 1. Therapeutic proteins, polypeptides and vaccines have become widely, and in many cases routinely used since the advent of the biotechnology era (ca 1980). The vast majority of these medicines require parenteral administration. The non-covalent interactions of therapeutic proteins define a tertiary (3-dimensional) structure which must be maintained to be biologically active.</p>\n<p>\n\tMaintaining the tertiary structure throughout the manufacture, formulation, transport, storage and use of therapeutic proteins is often difficult. Because parenteral administration is necessary, clearance is also often rapid and must be optimised. The pharmaceutical sciences are critical for transforming biotechnologically derived actives into viable and prac&shy;tical medicines.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring Semester 2 we will examine other important facets of the formulation sciences. Complex formulations of low molecular weight actives or in some cases, actives that do not have a defined structure have been developed. Often these actives are poorly soluble, but one important consideration is these actives are often characterised by a narrow therapeutic window. Again the pharmaceutical sciences are critical in transforming such actives into useful medicines and while more traditional dosage forms continue to be developed, the use of drug eluting, implantable dosage forms, e.g. microspheres or injectable implants is also important to improve efficacy and patient compliance. During Semester 2 of the module there will be considerable emphasis on clinical pharmaceutics where clinically registered medicines will be used as examples to illustrate how the pharmaceutical sciences can influence clinical outcome. An emphasis of the importance of clinical pharmaceutics provides the framework to show how knowledge of the underlying science of medicines is important in the day-to-day provision and use of medicines. We will also discuss the development of generic medicines in the context of protein therapeutics, complex formulations and narrow therapeutic index drugs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother general topic of this module relates to how new medicines and treatments are evolving. There is much more awareness about the need to ensure there is widespread access for both improved versions of existing medicines and new medicines. The pharmaceutical sciences can contribute to the increased access of medicines by making medicines more cost-effective and more practical to use (e.g. provision of ready to use dosage forms, no need for a cold chain). The pharmaceutical sciences play an important part in the lifecycle management of medicines. Life cycle management seeks to increase patient benefit, often by developing an improved version of a medicine that may be easier to administer or has a longer duration of action.&nbsp; As exemplified in the coursework and in some of the lectures, the need to consider a holistic perspective about healthcare will be encouraged.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>",

				"ModuleInstanceDescription": "<div>\n\tSaints were the celebrities of medieval Europe. From the miracles they worked to the rituals and journeys they inspired, holy bodies were invested with immense spiritual and political power. Relics were also hugely important as a source of aesthetic inspiration. This module explores art and architecture associated with physical remains of saints. Focusing especially on three cult sites in the Middle Ages - Jerusalem, Santiago de Compostela and Canterbury - we will see how imagery associated with saintly bodies adapts and morphs to suit the needs of different times and places. Looking at this imagery through the prism of categories such as translation, liminality, the simulacrum and the souvenir, the module asks how modern critical frameworks can reconnect us with the potency of the relic. As well as considering reliquaries and cult statues, we will explore such phenomena as mappaemundi or world maps, virtual or armchair pilgrimage, and replica buildings designed to &#39;translate&#39; sites associated with the Holy Land from East to West. At the end of the module we will also consider the afterlife of the relic. Why, in some parts of Europe, did the power of saintly remains seemingly diminish? Where and how has it re-emerged?</div>",

It aims to provide students with a good grounding in and an appreciation of the financial accounting essentials that any analyst, manager or business owner should possess.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tFinancial Accounting is concerned with accounting for the financial transactions and activities of a business in a particular financial period, and building the financial story of that period through the subsequent construction and publication of core financial statements: Balance Sheets, Income Statements, and Cash Flow Statements. In so doing it explains why profit and cash measurements of the same transactions and activities differ, and how Income Statements and Cash Flow Statements are constructed. The Accounting Equation of Assets = Liabilities is applied to the construction of the Balance Sheet. Contextually issues in revenue recognition and expense identification, and in the valuation of assets and liabilties are explored. The module shows students how to calculate financial ratios toanalyse and interpret the core financial statements to gain insights into financial health and performance, insights managers and other interested stakeholders, especially shareholders, are particularly interested in. The module also explores core aspects of Corporate Governanceand their implications for corporate reporting.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThis module (MSIN0004) is delivered in both Term 1 and 2 with the final examination to take place in the Summer term for both instances.&nbsp;</div>",

How did the experiences of men or women who experienced sexual desire for members of the same sex change over the course of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries? When did the idea of a homosexual, gay, lesbian, or queer identity appear in Britain? What was the role of legal changes (all homosexual acts between men in public or private were criminalised between 1885 and 1967) and of scientific knowledge in shaping identities and practices? These are the questions this module sets out to answer. It looks at legal changes relating to homosexuality and the development of scientific thinking on the subject. It also looks at changing queer subcultures, sexual practices, and sexual identities in Britain from the 1880s to the 1980s, asking how sexual practices related to sexual identities, and charting the development of self-conscious and proud LGBTQ+ identities.</p>",

When these interactions break down genetic disease may result, and it is often through these genetic mistakes that we are able to work out what happens in the normal situation. The module will introduce you to the subject of human genetics, enable you to appreciate the implications of genetic research for society and provide a basis for more advanced studies.&nbsp;At the end of the module, you should be able to understand and critically evaluate scientific studies in human genetics, whether reported in scientific journals or in the lay press.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe introductory lectures will remind you how Mendelian rules of inheritance can be applied to human families but that this is not always straightforward to interpret. Not all traits are inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion and the methods by which quantitative and multifactorial traits are studied will be introduced in the second half of the course.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe lectures on pedigrees are followed by a section on cytogenetics that covers the study of chromosomes and their abnormalities, followed by lectures on molecular genetics. The module continues with the study of inborn errors of metabolism and with the nature and origin of human genetic variation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second half of the module focuses on genetic mapping techniques which culminated in the multi-billion dollar human genome project. Within these lectures we examine gene mapping tools for both monogenic and polygenic diseases with examples that are interesting both for their own sake but also as examples of the results obtained using the molecular methods discussed earlier.&nbsp; The human genome project has now moved on from the study of the human DNA sequence to the study of variation between individuals and populations. The existence of genetic variation, polymorphism, has been known for many years and we look at this both from a historical perspective as well as considering how this is of interest to modern genetics, medicine and to the pharmaceutical industry. The module will cover the study of human populations and human origins and it will include discussions on the topic of bioethics through a debate.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>",

It will provide key illustrations of different responses to classical cultures in action and demonstrate how later cultures have viewed and made use of the classical world from their own historically situated standpoint. It also aims to equip students with the tools for further research in the reception of the classical world by developing their critical and conceptual understanding in this field. The module is taught by a range of experts in classical reception. It addresses theory, the history of reception (from within antiquity to the twenty-first century, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean). The module also explores the engagements of classical antiquity throughout the centuries with issues of gender, class, race, politics and national identity.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn term 1, &lsquo;reception studies&rsquo;&nbsp;and its theoretical approaches are introduced. Case studies of reception are then explored within antiquity and beyond up to the Renaissance, with a focus mainly on literary reception. In term 2, case studies of reception are explored from the Renaissance up to the present day,&nbsp;with&nbsp;an emphasis on material culture, art, museums, performance, film and political thought (and includes tours of the Petrie and the British Museums). MA Reception students are required to take the whole module (40 credits). Other MA students may take the whole module or just term 1 as a half module.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Skills</strong>: By the end of the module, students will be expected to have acquired: (1) an understanding of different methodological approaches to studying the reception of the classical world, and an ability to implement those approaches in practice; (2) an awareness of the various historical and contextual factors (including religion, politics, gender and sexuality) that contribute to different receptions of classical cultures in different historical periods, different societies, and different media; and an understanding of how these factors might have affected responses to the classical world in any given case; (3) a knowledge of core research techniques (including use of bibliographical, archival and digital resources) for studying reception of the classical world, and an understanding of how these techniques can be applied to a range of materials; (4) a knowledge of different receptions of classical cultures over a range of historical periods, and an ability to analyse those responses critically from an historical and cultural perspective.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Suggested preliminary reading:</strong> Beard, M. and Henderson, J. <em>Classics: A Very Short Introduction</em> (Oxford, 1995); Goldhill, S. <em>Love, Sex and Tragedy: How the Ancient World Shapes our Lives</em> (London, 2004); Hardwick, L.&nbsp; <em>Reception Studies</em> (Oxford, 2003); Silk, M., Gildenhard, I. and Barrow, R. <em>The Classical Tradition: Art, Literature, Thought </em>(Chicester, 2014); Willis, I., <em>Reception</em> (Routledge, 2018).</p>\n<p>\n\tInterested MA students who have further questions should contact Maria Wyke at <a href=\"mailto:m.wyke@ucl.ac.uk\">m.wyke@ucl.ac.uk</a></p>",

The overall aim of the module is to give a working knowledge of astronomy and cosmology from the Babylonians to the present. The course is divided into two roughly equal elements: (a) ancient and classical astronomy and cosmology to Einstein, and (b) modern astronomy and cosmology after Einstein. The course will rasie historical, technical and philosophical questions. By the end of the course students will have acquired: (1) A working knowledge of the history of astronomy and cosmology, (2) An appreciation of the development of views on the nature of space and time, (3) An appreciation of debates about man&rsquo;s place in the cosmos, (4) A basic technical knowledge of major ancient and modern theories, and (5) A knowledge of the philosophical principles underpinning cosmology and cosmogony.</p>",

The course is divided into two parts: (1) the epistemology of science and (2) the metaphysics of science. The first part of the course will focus on several central problems regarding the nature of scientific knowledge: how do scientists know if current scientific theories are true? Is science progressive? How do scientists test their theories and how are theories confirmed? Can science and pseudoscience be distinguished? How are sciences distinguished from one another? These questions will be discussed in the light of examples from science. During the course of discussing these problems, you will study some of the major positions that have been taken about scientific knowledge both in the history of philosophy and in the 20th century: Inductivism (Bacon), Logical Empiricism (Ayer and Quine), Falsificationism (Popper), Incommensurability (Kuhn) and Relativism (Feyerabend). What does it mean if more than two theories are consistent with the evidence (Quine/Duhem)? Philosophy of Science 1 will provide you with the background knowledge that you will need for other Philosophy courses that you will take in later years. You do not need prior knowledge of philosophy or science to do this course.</p>",

Across the centuries there have been many attempts to answer these and other questions surrounding the still-mysterious state of sleep.

What is the relation between the physical and mental aspects of sleep; why do some cultures see dreams as true, some see them as false, and other see them as the gateway to the unconscious? We discuss historical understandings of the physiology of sleep, the interpretations of dreams, the material culture of resting, the drugs that produce artificial sleep, and the ways sleeping and dreaming have been used in art, literature and film. The module is designed to familiarise students with the questions and literature in the history of sleep, including medical and psychological materials. The class will follow a seminar-based model, requiring students to read the materials critically and discuss the materials in class. As an advanced course, it is also intended to increase the student&rsquo;s analytical, research and writing skills.

				"ModuleInstanceDescription": "<p>\n\tThe role of voluntary organisations has been vital to social and political life throughout the history of modern Britain. Across the fields of social welfare, health, education/youth work, international development and humanitarian aid, non-governmental organisations have made significant contributions. The module introduces students to the latest research and debates, exploring change from challenges to Victorian and Edwardian models of philanthropy during and after the First World War to the age of the big international NGO in the 1980s. It highlights the importance of voluntary action for ordinary people &ndash; particularly women and young people &ndash; across the twentieth century, and promotes an enhanced understanding of the voluntary sector today. Drawing extensively on primary source material, the module is taught through 10 activity-based seminars. In particular, students are introduced to the material culture of charity in the past through object-based learning (OBL) and assessment includes writing an &lsquo;object report&rsquo; as well as a standard essay.</p>",

Students will learn the principles underlying all systematic reviews, and the ways that they vary &ndash; from different types of research question through to methods for synthesising both quantitative and qualitative findings. Students will apply tools that aid review production and apply methods to formulate review questions, identify research, classify and appraise studies, and plan syntheses of findings. They will apply their learning so as to critically appraise existing review reports. Students participate in workshops in a classroom at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE) or at a distance via Moodle, our virtual learning environment. Workshops will be recorded and made available on Moodle. All students will be expected to engage in additional individual and group activities online.</p>",

Among many topics, students in this module will examine the colonial construction of the &ldquo;native,&rdquo; intersections between race and gender under colonialism, and debates over autochthony and citizenship in postcolonial Africa. Students will also consider how new scholarship on race and slavery in Islamic Africa, racialization and sexuality under colonialism, and nativism in independent Africa is reshaping the field of African Studies. Questioning assumptions about Africa as a non-racialized space or a site of primordial ethnicity, this course will situate the study of ethnic and racial thought on the continent within broader scholarly debates across various disciplines.</p>",

Positioning such groups as intellectuals who shaped Iberian empires and the broader Atlantic world, this module analyzes their intellectual histories through an inter-disciplinary approach to works that they produced, including written traces in legal documents, religious treatises, contemporaneous histories, artifacts, art, and written correspondence.</p>",
