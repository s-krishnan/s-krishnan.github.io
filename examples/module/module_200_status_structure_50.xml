	This module focusses on the engineering concerns specific to the regions of the ocean near the coastline. It covers marine hydrodynamics and techniques to model waves, erosion and other coastal and offshore processes. The coursework project will relate to topics such as the design of coastal or offshore structures, options for use of an area of seabed, design of offshore renewable energy facilities and coastal defence planning for a region of the UK. The course includes a one-day field trip to the Sussex coast.&lt;/p&gt;

	The purpose of PHAY 0012 is to learn about the clinical importance of the formulation sciences and pharmaceutical processing.&amp;nbsp; Clinically registered medicines will be used to exemplify concepts. To have impact, the formulation sciences requires knowledge of the clinical end point.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Pharmaceutical Biotechnology is covered during semester 1. Therapeutic proteins, polypeptides and vaccines have become widely, and in many cases routinely used since the advent of the biotechnology era (ca 1980). The vast majority of these medicines require parenteral administration. The non-covalent interactions of therapeutic proteins define a tertiary (3-dimensional) structure which must be maintained to be biologically active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintaining the tertiary structure throughout the manufacture, formulation, transport, storage and use of therapeutic proteins is often difficult. Because parenteral administration is necessary, clearance is also often rapid and must be optimised. The pharmaceutical sciences are critical for transforming biotechnologically derived actives into viable and prac&amp;shy;tical medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During Semester 2 we will examine other important facets of the formulation sciences. Complex formulations of low molecular weight actives or in some cases, actives that do not have a defined structure have been developed. Often these actives are poorly soluble, but one important consideration is these actives are often characterised by a narrow therapeutic window. Again the pharmaceutical sciences are critical in transforming such actives into useful medicines and while more traditional dosage forms continue to be developed, the use of drug eluting, implantable dosage forms, e.g. microspheres or injectable implants is also important to improve efficacy and patient compliance. During Semester 2 of the module there will be considerable emphasis on clinical pharmaceutics where clinically registered medicines will be used as examples to illustrate how the pharmaceutical sciences can influence clinical outcome. An emphasis of the importance of clinical pharmaceutics provides the framework to show how knowledge of the underlying science of medicines is important in the day-to-day provision and use of medicines. We will also discuss the development of generic medicines in the context of protein therapeutics, complex formulations and narrow therapeutic index drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another general topic of this module relates to how new medicines and treatments are evolving. There is much more awareness about the need to ensure there is widespread access for both improved versions of existing medicines and new medicines. The pharmaceutical sciences can contribute to the increased access of medicines by making medicines more cost-effective and more practical to use (e.g. provision of ready to use dosage forms, no need for a cold chain). The pharmaceutical sciences play an important part in the lifecycle management of medicines. Life cycle management seeks to increase patient benefit, often by developing an improved version of a medicine that may be easier to administer or has a longer duration of action.&amp;nbsp; As exemplified in the coursework and in some of the lectures, the need to consider a holistic perspective about healthcare will be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

	Saints were the celebrities of medieval Europe. From the miracles they worked to the rituals and journeys they inspired, holy bodies were invested with immense spiritual and political power. Relics were also hugely important as a source of aesthetic inspiration. This module explores art and architecture associated with physical remains of saints. Focusing especially on three cult sites in the Middle Ages - Jerusalem, Santiago de Compostela and Canterbury - we will see how imagery associated with saintly bodies adapts and morphs to suit the needs of different times and places. Looking at this imagery through the prism of categories such as translation, liminality, the simulacrum and the souvenir, the module asks how modern critical frameworks can reconnect us with the potency of the relic. As well as considering reliquaries and cult statues, we will explore such phenomena as mappaemundi or world maps, virtual or armchair pilgrimage, and replica buildings designed to &amp;#39;translate&amp;#39; sites associated with the Holy Land from East to West. At the end of the module we will also consider the afterlife of the relic. Why, in some parts of Europe, did the power of saintly remains seemingly diminish? Where and how has it re-emerged?&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;Module information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Life on Earth&amp;rdquo; will begin by discussing the evidence for the emergence of life, the origins of the solar system and the conditions under which life emerged and the origin of eukaryotic cells. The theory behind reconstructing trees of evolutionary relatedness will be introduced and patterns of relatedness in the living world discussed, ranging from familiar creatures to new and bizarre forms being discovered in the depths of the oceans and under the earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. All main branches of life will be covered with a particular focus on the evolution of plants and their importance to global biodiversity and on the many groups of invertebrates and vertebrates including ourselves.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to lectures you will attend practical sessions in the Grant Museum of Zoology. At the end of the module you should be familiar with the diversity of living organisms; with classification of the living world; with the origins and history of life; and with the fundamental body plans of major groups of animals. You will have a solid grounding in modern ideas of the history of evolution of life on earth and understand the link between the evolution of developmental processes and the evolution of adult morphology.&lt;/p&gt;

	The &amp;#39;West&amp;#39; has long occupied a privileged place in U.S. geopolitics. Since the first decades of the nineteenth century, this region has heralded both the success and demise of the American experiment. This module considers the ways in which American visual culture (painting, photography, film, and city planning) has pictured, produced, critiqued and mythologized this geography. Central to our discussion of the spatial politics of empire building will be the particular importance of the figure of the &amp;#39;frontier&amp;#39; in American geopolitics. Why, we will ask, has the American frontier remained open-ended and ill-defined for the last two centuries? Does it mark a specific place? Is it a figure of modernity? As will become evident throughout the module, these questions were as central to the formation of the nation as they are today. Topics for discussion will include the organization of the US border with Mexico, immigration, land rights and gun control.&lt;/div&gt;

	In the past decades, increasing recognition has been given to the Jewish origins of Christianity and the Jewish context in which Christianity was formed. The scope and implications of this topic are wide. This module will restrict itself to the following, specific objectives: Firstly, to assess the nature of Judaism and Jewish life in the period when Christianity arose. This will involve the study of various Jewish groups that were active in this period, such as Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, as well as the study of post-Biblical Jewish literature including the Dead Sea scrolls. Students will gain an appreciation of the complexity of Judaism and its importance in ancient society. Secondly, to assess the nature of early Christianity in relation to Judaism, and to discuss whether, when, and how, Christianity &amp;#39;parted ways&amp;#39; from Judaism. Particular attention will be given to Jesus, Paul, and their successors&amp;#39; attitudes to the Jewish people, Jewish law, and Judaism. Thirdly, to consider Jewish-Christian relations, Christian attitudes to Judaism, and Jewish attitudes to Christianity, in the first few centuries of the Common Era. Admission to this module is open to students of all backgrounds and disciplines. All texts will be studied in translation.&lt;/div&gt;

	This module examines the history of European colonialism in Sub-Saharan Africa from the late nineteenth century to the 1960s. It introduces a range of important debates on the nature of colonial rule, its impact on African societies and economies and its consequences for understanding contemporary Africa. Through a detailed analysis of a number of case studies, the module examines the diverse forms taken by colonialism and the unevenness of its political, economic and social effects. It engages with debates on the production of &amp;lsquo;colonial knowledge&amp;rsquo; and on the cultural dimensions of colonial rule and it examines the work of a range of African thinkers of the colonial period. Amongst other topics, we will examine the nature of colonial legal and political structures, the role of religion, the impact of European settlers, changing gender relations and the emergence of nationalist thinking.&lt;/div&gt;

	An integrated module in molecular biology that is taught through lectures, tutorials and a laboratory-based experimental research project. The laboratory project and associated tutorials will introduces you to the processes of DNA cloning and DNA analyses. In the research component emphasis is placed on technical and numerical skills, scientific observation and data analyses. You will write your research project results in the form of a scientific paper and give an oral presentation to your tutor group. You will therefore gain experience in communicating scientific results and findings. To help you prepare for the practicals and exams there will be formative pre-practical quizzes and online bespoke exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After taking this module you should be able to describe the key concepts and areas of molecular biology findings in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. More specifically you will be expected to know and understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Nucleic acids, their structure and properties and how these are used in research techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li value=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
		Plasmids and their properties and how the plasmids will be manipulated in the laboratory research project. (Plasmids are used in the laboratory research project).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li value=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
		How information passes between bacteria through the processes of transformation and conjugation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li value=&quot;4&quot;&gt;

	This module provides students with an introductory level orientation to core accounting principles and their applications, both internal and external, to a business organisation. It aims to provide students with a good grounding in and an appreciation of the financial accounting essentials that any analyst, manager or business owner should possess.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Financial Accounting is concerned with accounting for the financial transactions and activities of a business in a particular financial period, and building the financial story of that period through the subsequent construction and publication of core financial statements: Balance Sheets, Income Statements, and Cash Flow Statements. In so doing it explains why profit and cash measurements of the same transactions and activities differ, and how Income Statements and Cash Flow Statements are constructed. The Accounting Equation of Assets = Liabilities is applied to the construction of the Balance Sheet. Contextually issues in revenue recognition and expense identification, and in the valuation of assets and liabilties are explored. The module shows students how to calculate financial ratios toanalyse and interpret the core financial statements to gain insights into financial health and performance, insights managers and other interested stakeholders, especially shareholders, are particularly interested in. The module also explores core aspects of Corporate Governanceand their implications for corporate reporting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	This module (MSIN0004) is delivered in both Term 1 and 2 with the final examination to take place in the Summer term for both instances.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

	How can we, and how should we, write the history of sex and sexuality? How did the experiences of men or women who experienced sexual desire for members of the same sex change over the course of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries? When did the idea of a homosexual, gay, lesbian, or queer identity appear in Britain? What was the role of legal changes (all homosexual acts between men in public or private were criminalised between 1885 and 1967) and of scientific knowledge in shaping identities and practices? These are the questions this module sets out to answer. It looks at legal changes relating to homosexuality and the development of scientific thinking on the subject. It also looks at changing queer subcultures, sexual practices, and sexual identities in Britain from the 1880s to the 1980s, asking how sexual practices related to sexual identities, and charting the development of self-conscious and proud LGBTQ+ identities.&lt;/p&gt;

	This course offers students an overview of selective aspects of the history of twentieth-century London, set within the wider context of twentieth-century British history and politics, imperial history and decolonization. This is not a comprehensive and detailed history of the city itself; rather, London as a &amp;lsquo;imperial metropole&amp;rsquo; is used as a lens through which to explore broader questions about changing collective identities such as Englishness, Britishness, and the imperial. Case studies may include efforts to create &amp;lsquo;imperial architecture&amp;rsquo; in London c. 1900; intellectuals and imperialism in late Edwardian Bloomsbury; Americanisation in the 1920s &amp;lsquo;jazz age&amp;rsquo;; Cable Street and the anti-fascist struggle; the Blitz and its trans-Atlantic dimensions; and post-war &amp;lsquo;New Commonwealth&amp;rsquo; immigration in places such as Brixton and Notting Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;Module information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The unifying topic of &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Human Genetics&amp;rdquo; is how genes and their interactions, either with other genes or with the environment, make us what we are. When these interactions break down genetic disease may result, and it is often through these genetic mistakes that we are able to work out what happens in the normal situation. The module will introduce you to the subject of human genetics, enable you to appreciate the implications of genetic research for society and provide a basis for more advanced studies.&amp;nbsp;At the end of the module, you should be able to understand and critically evaluate scientific studies in human genetics, whether reported in scientific journals or in the lay press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The introductory lectures will remind you how Mendelian rules of inheritance can be applied to human families but that this is not always straightforward to interpret. Not all traits are inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion and the methods by which quantitative and multifactorial traits are studied will be introduced in the second half of the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lectures on pedigrees are followed by a section on cytogenetics that covers the study of chromosomes and their abnormalities, followed by lectures on molecular genetics. The module continues with the study of inborn errors of metabolism and with the nature and origin of human genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second half of the module focuses on genetic mapping techniques which culminated in the multi-billion dollar human genome project. Within these lectures we examine gene mapping tools for both monogenic and polygenic diseases with examples that are interesting both for their own sake but also as examples of the results obtained using the molecular methods discussed earlier.&amp;nbsp; The human genome project has now moved on from the study of the human DNA sequence to the study of variation between individuals and populations. The existence of genetic variation, polymorphism, has been known for many years and we look at this both from a historical perspective as well as considering how this is of interest to modern genetics, medicine and to the pharmaceutical industry. The module will cover the study of human populations and human origins and it will include discussions on the topic of bioethics through a debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

	This is a broad-based cell biology module that aims to introduce the student to a wide range of topics related to the biological functioning of eukaryotic cells. The lectures are divided into the following four major themes:- A) structural and functional anatomy of eukaryotic cells, B) experimental methods in cell biology, C) cell growth, division and the cell cycle, D) multicellular life and cell specialization and differentiation. Assessments cover interpretation of images of cells obtained with an electron microscope and a fluorescence microscope including semi-quantitative analysis. The coursework forms an important part of the module and is designed to illustrate specific cellular processes and techniques in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Module information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Running in Term 1 CELL0009 is a broad-based cell biology module that aims to introduce students who have taken cell or molecular biology in Year 1 (BIOC0001 and or CELL0007/CELL0008/BIOS0005) to a wide range of topics related to the biological functioning of eukaryotic cells. &amp;nbsp;It will prepare you for more specialised modules in the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; year. &amp;nbsp;Through lectures, online practical assignments in the form of Moodle quizzes and a dry lab on cell biology microscopy data interpretation this module will provide up-to-date coverage of a broad range of topics in eukaryotic cell biology. &amp;nbsp;Coursework is an important part of your study and is designed to illustrate specific cellular processes and techniques in more detail, to support and enhance the lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Indicative lecture topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following is a typical example of topics; precise contents in any given year of study may change with module updates and development:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		cell structure and function,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		function of organelles and intracellular compartmentalisation,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		organelle biogenesis and protein/membrane trafficking (including the transport of proteins to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, peroxisomes, mitochondria, chloroplast, secretory vesicles, plasma membrane, as well as processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis),&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		structure and function of biological membranes,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		structure and function of the cytoskeleton (including microtubules, microfilaments etc.),&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		cell division and the cell cycle,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		experimental methods used in cell biology (including tissue culture, microscopy, and protein expression and analysis techniques),&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		cell specialization and differentiation,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		multicellular life (including stem cells, control of cell growth and programmed cell death).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Module Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Students should note that this module does not specifically cover signalling and signal transduction. For detailed coverage in this area, students are recommended to take CELL0010. &amp;nbsp;To combine the cell biology of CELL0009 and the cell signalling of CELL0010 students should take course CELL0011 (registration for both CELL0009 and CELL0010 independently will not be permitted). &amp;nbsp;Note, CELL0011 is popular and additional places available beyond students for whom it is compulsory (listed, below) are limited. &amp;nbsp;Note if you are a student on BioMedSci stream 5 (Cells and Molecules) or the Cell Biology stream of Natural Sciences you need to register (compulsory) for CELL0011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This module is co-taught with CELL0011. &amp;nbsp;Places are limited to a combined total of 144 (CELL0011 is capped at 96, so typically the cap for CELL0009 is 48). &amp;nbsp;CELL0009 is an option for students on Biosciences and Natural Sciences programmes and may be taken as an elective by students (including affiliate students) on other degree programmes. &amp;nbsp;In the event of module over-subscription, the module may not be available as an elective.&lt;/p&gt;

	This module, which has a special focus on the distant or &amp;#39;outreach&amp;#39; tutor, has been specifically developed to provide a professional development course for HE and FE tutors. It has been designed for tutors to reflect on their own role as responsible tutors when managing the teaching and learning within their own context of work in order to develop students&amp;#39; learning. The module offers guidelines about the responsibilities that tutors undertake, especially in relation to the programme or course within which their modules might be set. Effective use of virtual learning environments is included in discussions of learning and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Participants are expected to submit coursework evidencing their reading in the field and their reflections upon their experience or expected experience of being a Tutor or leader in their course.&lt;br /&gt;
	The module is taught online and will run in the Autumn term in 2019-20.&lt;/p&gt;

	This research methodology module does not have participants carry out a piece of action research but does explore all the challenges and advantages of action research. Participants consider an area of research in their setting, make a research proposal and consider the feasibility of their research question being answered through action research methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The module is presented through six units: Educational research and developing research questions; Research methodologies, paradigms and drafting a research proposal; Autobiography and Reflective Writing; Research methods, methods of enquiry and refining the research proposal; Thinking about field study: action research in educational settings; Refining the proposal for submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The module is taught online and will run in the Autumn term and the Summer term in 2019-20.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;ims:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This module is about the economic effects of taxation, and economic aspects of tax policy. It aims to give students an understanding of the key economic issues in tax policy, and to show how these can be analysed using standard tools of theoretical and empirical economic analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; At the end of the module, students should:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul class=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Have a knowledge of the structure of taxation in at least one country&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Be familiar with basic economic concepts and methods relating to taxation, including incidence and efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Have an understanding of some of the key behavioural effects of taxes, including those on consumer spending, labour supply, saving and investment.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Be able to analyse, using relevant economic concepts and methods, a number of issues in tax policy, such as the optimal structure of indirect taxes, and the relative merits of different forms of income taxation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Suitable for&lt;/strong&gt;: 2nd / final year Economics (L100 / L101 / L102) and final year BSc Economics and Geography (LL17), BA Philosophy and Economics (VL51) and&amp;nbsp; BSc Philosophy Politics and Economics (4V86) students.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: ECON0002: Economics. Students should have taken, or be concurrently taking, ECON0013: Microeconomics (or equivalents).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Assumed knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;: The module mainly makes use of ideas and methods drawn from microeconomic theory, including the standard theories of&amp;nbsp;consumer and producer&amp;nbsp;behaviour and the core ideas of welfare economics. Students coming into the module should be familiar with constrained optimisation, Pareto optimality,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;income and substitution effects of price changes,&amp;nbsp;measures of welfare change, etc. In addition, it would be useful if students had a basic understanding of econometric methods, and in particular the ability to interpret the results of econometric&amp;nbsp;regressions.&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;span style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: 0px 0px; font-weight: 600;&quot;&gt;Content:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The module aims to introduce students to the principal issues, ideas and methods involved in studying the reception of the classical world across a range of periods, societies, and media. It will provide key illustrations of different responses to classical cultures in action and demonstrate how later cultures have viewed and made use of the classical world from their own historically situated standpoint. It also aims to equip students with the tools for further research in the reception of the classical world by developing their critical and conceptual understanding in this field. The module is taught by a range of experts in classical reception. It addresses theory, the history of reception (from within antiquity to the twenty-first century, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean). The module also explores the engagements of classical antiquity throughout the centuries with issues of gender, class, race, politics and national identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In term 1, &amp;lsquo;reception studies&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp;and its theoretical approaches are introduced. Case studies of reception are then explored within antiquity and beyond up to the Renaissance, with a focus mainly on literary reception. In term 2, case studies of reception are explored from the Renaissance up to the present day,&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;an emphasis on material culture, art, museums, performance, film and political thought (and includes tours of the Petrie and the British Museums). MA Reception students are required to take the whole module (40 credits). Other MA students may take the whole module or just term 1 as a half module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;: By the end of the module, students will be expected to have acquired: (1) an understanding of different methodological approaches to studying the reception of the classical world, and an ability to implement those approaches in practice; (2) an awareness of the various historical and contextual factors (including religion, politics, gender and sexuality) that contribute to different receptions of classical cultures in different historical periods, different societies, and different media; and an understanding of how these factors might have affected responses to the classical world in any given case; (3) a knowledge of core research techniques (including use of bibliographical, archival and digital resources) for studying reception of the classical world, and an understanding of how these techniques can be applied to a range of materials; (4) a knowledge of different receptions of classical cultures over a range of historical periods, and an ability to analyse those responses critically from an historical and cultural perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Suggested preliminary reading:&lt;/strong&gt; Beard, M. and Henderson, J. &lt;em&gt;Classics: A Very Short Introduction&lt;/em&gt; (Oxford, 1995); Goldhill, S. &lt;em&gt;Love, Sex and Tragedy: How the Ancient World Shapes our Lives&lt;/em&gt; (London, 2004); Hardwick, L.&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;Reception Studies&lt;/em&gt; (Oxford, 2003); Silk, M., Gildenhard, I. and Barrow, R. &lt;em&gt;The Classical Tradition: Art, Literature, Thought &lt;/em&gt;(Chicester, 2014); Willis, I., &lt;em&gt;Reception&lt;/em&gt; (Routledge, 2018).&lt;/p&gt;

	This module examines the interplay between values and social sciences. It asks both how the social sciences are or should be influenced by values and how moral or political philosophy should incorporate the findings of the social sciences. The course has two overall aims: first, to encourage critical reflection on the methodology of the social sciences and, second, to explore the relationship between normative philosophy and the social sciences.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	This module will address questions including: Are the social sciences inevitably more value-laden than the natural sciences? Should citizens decide what gets researched? Can there be moral reasons for social scientists to refrain from researching particular topics or communicating their results? What can and should moral and political philosophy learn from the social sciences? What should the relation between political philosophy and political science be like?&lt;/div&gt;

	This course is a continuation of HPSC0004 Philosophy of Science, intended for students that have completed that course or studied a similar introduction to philosophy of science elsewhere. The course explores some central debates in general philosophy of science, including: arguments, realism and antirealism about scientific theories, scientific explanation, laws of nature, reductionism and the unity of science. After this course you should possess a fairly well-rounded view of the field, as well as a set of skills that will allow you to work further on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

	This module is designed to analyse and question the recurring argument in modern society which claims that science and religion are and have always been in conflict with one another. The belief that there are fundamental and irreconcilable differences between these two systems and the ways they view the world actually has a much more recent history than is generally assumed, arising primarily out of the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries. This module explores the ways in which people in different cultures and different time periods have attempted to navigate between naturalistic and faith-based understandings of the world we inhabit. We will look at several cultures including the Christian, Islamic and Chinese traditions, as well as various themes such as cosmology, Darwinism and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

It will approach the subject topically through key issues such as the role of science in governance, overseas trade and collecting the development of navigation and cartography slavery and the circulation of knowledge. Participants will consider how the sciences made empire possible and how imperial expansion reshaped the sciences in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

	This module aims explore the relationships between science, war and the prevention of war.&amp;nbsp; It will place military and security technologies within social, political, and historical contexts.&amp;nbsp; There is particular emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and on weapons usually designated as `unconventional&amp;rsquo; or `weapons of mass destruction&amp;rsquo;. In addition to thinking about how science, technology and warfare have shaped each other, this module also considers the changing role of the scientist in relation to the state, and considers broader themes such as the arms control, disarmament, ethics, and popular culture in relation to war. Students attend one 2 hour lecture seminar per week.&lt;/p&gt;

	This module explores the history of humanity&amp;rsquo;s changing conceptions of the universe, from the ancient world to the current day. Issues examined will include the origins and development of astronomy, theories of the origin of the universe and of the nature of the universe, ideas of humanity&amp;rsquo;s place in the cosmos. The overall aim of the module is to give a working knowledge of astronomy and cosmology from the Babylonians to the present. The course is divided into two roughly equal elements: (a) ancient and classical astronomy and cosmology to Einstein, and (b) modern astronomy and cosmology after Einstein. The course will rasie historical, technical and philosophical questions. By the end of the course students will have acquired: (1) A working knowledge of the history of astronomy and cosmology, (2) An appreciation of the development of views on the nature of space and time, (3) An appreciation of debates about man&amp;rsquo;s place in the cosmos, (4) A basic technical knowledge of major ancient and modern theories, and (5) A knowledge of the philosophical principles underpinning cosmology and cosmogony.&lt;/p&gt;

	This is an introductory module in the philosophy of science. The course is divided into two parts: (1) the epistemology of science and (2) the metaphysics of science. The first part of the course will focus on several central problems regarding the nature of scientific knowledge: how do scientists know if current scientific theories are true? Is science progressive? How do scientists test their theories and how are theories confirmed? Can science and pseudoscience be distinguished? How are sciences distinguished from one another? These questions will be discussed in the light of examples from science. During the course of discussing these problems, you will study some of the major positions that have been taken about scientific knowledge both in the history of philosophy and in the 20th century: Inductivism (Bacon), Logical Empiricism (Ayer and Quine), Falsificationism (Popper), Incommensurability (Kuhn) and Relativism (Feyerabend). What does it mean if more than two theories are consistent with the evidence (Quine/Duhem)? Philosophy of Science 1 will provide you with the background knowledge that you will need for other Philosophy courses that you will take in later years. You do not need prior knowledge of philosophy or science to do this course.&lt;/p&gt;

	This module is designed to equip students with the in-depth empirical understanding, theoretical knowledge and analytical skills necessary to grasp, discuss and evaluate how the European Union and its main political processes operate.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The first part of the module outlines the historical context which led to European integration and examines how the European Union has evolved, and introduces theories used to account for patterns and process in European integration. The second part of the module examines the institutions, the policy-making process, decision-making mechanisms and discusses the crisis of legitimacy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The final section of the module outlines and critically assesses key policy areas in the European Union. These include, the Single Market, Economic and Monetary Union, the Common Agricultural Policy, Cohesion Policy, the internal and external dimensions of security and the EU as an international actor. The activities in the module will promote not only individual study and research but will place a great deal of emphasis on teamwork, group discussion and debate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Students will gain specific knowledge about the history and structure of the European Union and develop a mode of thinking that will allow them to examine other contemporary political issues, such as democracy, the nature of the modern state, global governance, and the global economy in crisis and international relations in the post-Cold War era in a more critical way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Please note that POLS0020 - The Politics of the European Union - is an advanced Political Science module. Its delivery is based on the assumption that you are familiar with concepts and theories central to the field. If this is not the case, you may find additional background reading necessary to appropriately engage with the module material. The following texts are recommended:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	* Cini, M. and N. P&amp;eacute;rez-Sol&amp;oacute;rzano Borragan (eds.) (2013), European Union Politics, 4th edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press - this is the core text for the module and&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	each week&amp;rsquo;s introductory reading includes relevant chapters from this book. It provides a very good introduction to the key theories and institutions as well as policies.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	* Dinan, D. (2010), Ever Closer Union. An Introduction to European Integration, London: Palgrave Macmillan - particularly chapters 1&amp;ndash;2 for an introduction to the history and background of European integration.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	* Tranholm-Mikkelsen, J. (1991), &amp;lsquo;Neofunctionalism: Obstinate or Obsolete?&amp;rsquo;, Journal of International Studies 20(1): 1&amp;ndash;22 - a useful introduction to Neofunctionalism, one of the key theories we examine in the module.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	* Pollack, M. (1997), &amp;lsquo;Delegation, Agency and Agenda-Setting in the European Community&amp;rsquo;, International Organization, 51(1): 99&amp;ndash;134 - discussing the relationship between member states and supranational institutions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You may also want to look at the POLS0020 (POLS7006A/B) reading list from last year (accessible via the UCL Library) to get an idea of the readings and topics covered in the module itself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	This module may not be taken by students who have previously taken POLS6006A/B&lt;/div&gt;

	What happens during sleep? Why do we dream? Across the centuries there have been many attempts to answer these and other questions surrounding the still-mysterious state of sleep. This course is designed to explore the different ways sleeping and dreaming have been understood in the past, both distant and recent. What is the relation between the physical and mental aspects of sleep; why do some cultures see dreams as true, some see them as false, and other see them as the gateway to the unconscious? We discuss historical understandings of the physiology of sleep, the interpretations of dreams, the material culture of resting, the drugs that produce artificial sleep, and the ways sleeping and dreaming have been used in art, literature and film. The module is designed to familiarise students with the questions and literature in the history of sleep, including medical and psychological materials. The class will follow a seminar-based model, requiring students to read the materials critically and discuss the materials in class. As an advanced course, it is also intended to increase the student&amp;rsquo;s analytical, research and writing skills. The research essay requires students to gather the primary and secondary literature on a topic, synthesise the material and hone their abilities at making a sustained argument.&lt;/p&gt;

	This module focuses on the many different ways in which publics engage with science in face-to-face contexts. Teaching will particularly focus on direct interactions within governance and policy settings, museums and other more informal activities, and on how specific public groups, such as patient and citizen groups get involved, and engage with, scientific and medical research. Group projects will develop a practical understanding of how to organize such activities, alongside which students will critically reflect on the theory and context that underpins such activities such as models of publics and audiences, rationales for engagement in different contexts and the wider policy contexts and historical trends.&lt;/p&gt;

	The role of voluntary organisations has been vital to social and political life throughout the history of modern Britain. Across the fields of social welfare, health, education/youth work, international development and humanitarian aid, non-governmental organisations have made significant contributions. The module introduces students to the latest research and debates, exploring change from challenges to Victorian and Edwardian models of philanthropy during and after the First World War to the age of the big international NGO in the 1980s. It highlights the importance of voluntary action for ordinary people &amp;ndash; particularly women and young people &amp;ndash; across the twentieth century, and promotes an enhanced understanding of the voluntary sector today. Drawing extensively on primary source material, the module is taught through 10 activity-based seminars. In particular, students are introduced to the material culture of charity in the past through object-based learning (OBL) and assessment includes writing an &amp;lsquo;object report&amp;rsquo; as well as a standard essay.&lt;/p&gt;

	Systematic reviews use robust methods to identify and examine existing research reports on a given topic and to produce accessible, reliable and useful syntheses or maps of research, often for policy or practice audiences. Students will learn the principles underlying all systematic reviews, and the ways that they vary &amp;ndash; from different types of research question through to methods for synthesising both quantitative and qualitative findings. Students will apply tools that aid review production and apply methods to formulate review questions, identify research, classify and appraise studies, and plan syntheses of findings. They will apply their learning so as to critically appraise existing review reports. Students participate in workshops in a classroom at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE) or at a distance via Moodle, our virtual learning environment. Workshops will be recorded and made available on Moodle. All students will be expected to engage in additional individual and group activities online.&lt;/p&gt;

	This interdisciplinary module will examine the development of racial and ethnic thought, xenophobia, and related forms of exclusion in Africa from the nineteenth century to the present day. Among many topics, students in this module will examine the colonial construction of the &amp;ldquo;native,&amp;rdquo; intersections between race and gender under colonialism, and debates over autochthony and citizenship in postcolonial Africa. Students will also consider how new scholarship on race and slavery in Islamic Africa, racialization and sexuality under colonialism, and nativism in independent Africa is reshaping the field of African Studies. Questioning assumptions about Africa as a non-racialized space or a site of primordial ethnicity, this course will situate the study of ethnic and racial thought on the continent within broader scholarly debates across various disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

	Through the lens of social and intellectual histories of empire in the Iberian world, the seminars consider how colonial subjects in the Iberian empires &amp;ndash; including free black and indigenous American populations &amp;ndash; shaped empire, religion, and science through daily practices and litigation. We explore how indigenous Americans and African Diaspora responded to the intellectual milieus of empire. Positioning such groups as intellectuals who shaped Iberian empires and the broader Atlantic world, this module analyzes their intellectual histories through an inter-disciplinary approach to works that they produced, including written traces in legal documents, religious treatises, contemporaneous histories, artifacts, art, and written correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;
