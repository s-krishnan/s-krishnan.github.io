				"ModuleInstanceDescription": "<p>\n\t<strong>Aims:</strong><br />\n\tThis module provides an introduction to computer security concepts and techniques. It covers core security principles to engineer systems that provide properties like confidentiality, integrity or availability, despite the efforts of malicious entities to subvert them.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>Learning outcomes:</strong><br />\n\tStudents will learn how to recognise security properties of systems, as well as formulate security policies, and model the threats they may face. Through exposure to a number of established industry and government security mechanisms and design patterns, they will be able to select appropriate controls to guarantee that the security policies are implemented robustly and may resist efforts to subvert them. Conversely, students will gain skills in analysing computer systems, and developing strategies to bypass security controls.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>Content:</strong><br />\n\tThe first half of the course covers the basic principles, security policies, access control (theory and practice); hardware and OS security fundamentals which underpin security of systems. Then we dive into the details of various technical protection mechanisms and computer attacks including hardware, network and operating system security attacks; We learn about defensive technology in high-integrity systems. We study basic attacks in web security. We study user authentication and identification and how applied cryptography is used in TLS and network security. The module provides strong foundations in security engineering, and enables students to more easily follow other modules in Information Security and in Applied Cryptography.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>Requisites:</strong><br />\n\tIn order to be eligible to select this module, a student must Â¿be registered on a programme for which it is a formally-approved option or elective choice AND have taken the equivalent of the core modules of a UK-equivalent Honours Degree (or higher) in the field of Computer Science (in particular, operating systems, networking, computer architecture.)<br />\n\t<br />\n\tSome mathematics are useful to know: discrete mathematics, probability, logic, partial orders, entropy.</p>",

All readings are in translation.<br />\n\tTopics included in this broad survey module vary slightly from year to year.&nbsp; Authors and genres covered may include the following: Homer; lyric poetry; Herodotus and Thucydides; Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides; Aristophanes; Plato and Aristotle; Hellenistic poetry; and ancient prose fiction. Twice weekly classes take as a starting point selected readings from major authors; the format is mixed lecture and discussion. The module will provide basic information and a chronological and thematic framework and is intended as an introduction to ancient Greek literature and theoretical approaches to literature. It will also introduce students to authors and genres of which they might not otherwise have experience. Students will be expected to equip themselves with specified translations of some works which are cheaply available in paperback; other texts will be supplied as handouts.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Skills: </strong>By the end of the module, students should be trained in close reading, analysis of form, content and context, synthesis of ideas and the ability to present written and oral conclusions about a complex body of data in a coherent fashion.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Texts: </strong>Simon Goldhill, Love, Sex and Tragedy: Why Classics Matter (2005); Edith Hall, Introducing the Ancient Greeks (2015).</p>",

An Athenian writer, Xenophon travelled widely across the Greek world and Asia Minor, and wrote about his experiences with different cultures, both Greek and non-Greek. His texts discuss controversial issues of his day &ndash; conflict between Greeks, Spartan society and power, Persian imperialism, relations with foreign lands, and citizenly behaviour in Athens. Unlike most writers from his period, he wrote across a wide range of genres, such as history, philosophical dialogue and rhetoric, as well introducing new forms such as travel writing, biography and the novel. The module will examine a range of his texts, considering the relationship between cultural representation, politics and literary form, and addressing questions of Greek identity, concepts of Otherness, power relations and class consciousness in the context of the development of Classical Greek prose writing.</p>\n<p class=\"p\" helvetica=\"\" lucida=\"\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-position: 0px 0px; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \">\n\t<span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: 0px 0px; font-weight: 600;\">Skills</span>: Students will develop their awareness of critical approaches to texts, their understanding of the relations between form, content and context, and their ability in close reading and in oral and written analysis.</p>\n<p class=\"p\" helvetica=\"\" lucida=\"\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-position: 0px 0px; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \">\n\t<span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: 0px 0px; font-weight: 600;\">Introductory reading:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\" helvetica=\"\" lucida=\"\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-position: 0px 0px; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \">\n\tStudents are advised to obtain&nbsp;translations of Xenophon&#39;s works, for example:</p>\n<p class=\"p\" helvetica=\"\" lucida=\"\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-position: 0px 0px; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \">\n\t<em style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: 0px 0px;\">The Expedition of Cyrus</em>, trans.

It will provide key illustrations of different responses to classical cultures in action and demonstrate how later cultures have viewed and made use of the classical world from their own historically situated standpoint. It also aims to equip students with the tools for further research in the reception of the classical world by developing their critical and conceptual understanding in this field. The module is taught by a range of experts in classical reception. It addresses theory, the history of reception (from within antiquity to the twenty-first century, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean). The module also explores the engagements of classical antiquity throughout the centuries with issues of gender, class, race, politics and national identity.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn term 1, &lsquo;reception studies&rsquo;&nbsp;and its theoretical approaches are introduced. Case studies of reception are then explored within antiquity and beyond up to the Renaissance, with a focus mainly on literary reception. In term 2, case studies of reception are explored from the Renaissance up to the present day,&nbsp;with&nbsp;an emphasis on material culture, art, museums, performance, film and political thought (and includes tours of the Petrie and the British Museums). MA Reception students are required to take the whole module (40 credits). Other MA students may take the whole module or just term 1 as a half module.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Skills</strong>: By the end of the module, students will be expected to have acquired: (1) an understanding of different methodological approaches to studying the reception of the classical world, and an ability to implement those approaches in practice; (2) an awareness of the various historical and contextual factors (including religion, politics, gender and sexuality) that contribute to different receptions of classical cultures in different historical periods, different societies, and different media; and an understanding of how these factors might have affected responses to the classical world in any given case; (3) a knowledge of core research techniques (including use of bibliographical, archival and digital resources) for studying reception of the classical world, and an understanding of how these techniques can be applied to a range of materials; (4) a knowledge of different receptions of classical cultures over a range of historical periods, and an ability to analyse those responses critically from an historical and cultural perspective.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Suggested preliminary reading:</strong> Beard, M. and Henderson, J. <em>Classics: A Very Short Introduction</em> (Oxford, 1995); Goldhill, S. <em>Love, Sex and Tragedy: How the Ancient World Shapes our Lives</em> (London, 2004); Hardwick, L.&nbsp; <em>Reception Studies</em> (Oxford, 2003); Silk, M., Gildenhard, I. and Barrow, R. <em>The Classical Tradition: Art, Literature, Thought </em>(Chicester, 2014); Willis, I., <em>Reception</em> (Routledge, 2018).</p>\n<p>\n\tInterested MA students who have further questions should contact Maria Wyke at <a href=\"mailto:m.wyke@ucl.ac.uk\">m.wyke@ucl.ac.uk</a></p>",

Through a detailed analysis of a number of case studies, the module examines the diverse forms taken by colonialism and the unevenness of its political, economic and social effects. It engages with debates on the production of &lsquo;colonial knowledge&rsquo; and on the cultural dimensions of colonial rule and it examines the work of a range of African thinkers of the colonial period. Amongst other topics, we will examine the nature of colonial legal and political structures, the role of religion, the impact of European settlers, changing gender relations and the emergence of nationalist thinking.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>",

The course is divided into two parts: (1) the epistemology of science and (2) the metaphysics of science. The first part of the course will focus on several central problems regarding the nature of scientific knowledge: how do scientists know if current scientific theories are true? Is science progressive? How do scientists test their theories and how are theories confirmed? Can science and pseudoscience be distinguished? How are sciences distinguished from one another? These questions will be discussed in the light of examples from science. During the course of discussing these problems, you will study some of the major positions that have been taken about scientific knowledge both in the history of philosophy and in the 20th century: Inductivism (Bacon), Logical Empiricism (Ayer and Quine), Falsificationism (Popper), Incommensurability (Kuhn) and Relativism (Feyerabend). What does it mean if more than two theories are consistent with the evidence (Quine/Duhem)? Philosophy of Science 1 will provide you with the background knowledge that you will need for other Philosophy courses that you will take in later years. You do not need prior knowledge of philosophy or science to do this course.</p>",

The module introduces students to both the practical study and the interpretation of a broad spectrum of Latin inscriptions, ranging in date from the archaic to the late Roman periods. This module is designed for those taking UCL MA/MSc degrees in the Institute of Archaeology, History, Medieval and Renaissance Studies, and the School of Languages and Cultures.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe module gives an overview of important skills for the use of inscriptions in historical, philological, and archaeological research and offers an introduction to both the practical techniques of recording, deciphering, and interpreting inscribed Latin texts and the techniques of editing and preparing epigraphic texts for publication. The main guides and resources for the practice of the discipline are introduced, and students learn how to use them. This module exploits the material in various collections in central London (the British Museum, University College London, and the Museum of London) to introduce students to a wide variety of examples of different types of inscriptions from various regions of the Roman world, drawn from an extensive chronological range, from the earliest inscriptions of the 8th century BC to the last phases of the significant use of inscriptions in civic life, in the 6th century AD.</p>\n<p>\n\tPlease note: There are no formal pre-requisites but students entering this module should usually have a good pass in Beginners&rsquo; Latin or the equivalent (as a minimum).</p>",

				"ModuleInstanceDescription": "<p>\n\tIn his famous book <em>The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914&ndash;1991</em>, Eric Hobsbawm describes the disastrous failures of state communism, capitalism, and nationalism. Nowhere was the tragedy of the twentieth century more apparent than in the Balkans. What initiated as the dawn of an age of liberation from old Empires and catching up with the rest of the continent turned into a century of wars and violence between new nation states or within them coupled with their perpetual if not increased lagging behind the rest of Europe. This course will combine a chronological and thematic approach in order to explore the political, social, cultural and economic factors affecting such an outcome. It will look at foreign influence as well as domestic agency with the aim to unravel the great changes and lost opportunities of the recent dramatic history of the Balkans. Dominated as it was by conflict and oppression the twentieth century in the Balkans was also the time of great transformations and brilliant achievements of many Balkanites, whose trajectories will be illuminated both in lectures and reading.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are three mutually interrelated aims of the module:</p>\n<p>\n\t1. to acquire a body of knowledge relating to the history of the Balkans in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including an understanding of key historiographical debates;</p>\n<p>\n\t2. to develop a nuanced understanding of broader concepts and methodologies relevant to the study of history;</p>\n<p>\n\t3. To develop a variety of analytic and research skills, including the structuring of complex arguments, the assessment of secondary literature and historiographical debates, primary source criticism, and map skills.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the aim is to give the student a framework for understanding the totality of modern South-East European history and culture, students with an interest in a specific country will be able to set that subject against a broader Balkan (and European) background and submit coursework on their country of choice.</p>",

It highlights the importance of voluntary action for ordinary people &ndash; particularly women and young people &ndash; across the twentieth century, and promotes an enhanced understanding of the voluntary sector today. Drawing extensively on primary source material, the module is taught through 10 activity-based seminars. In particular, students are introduced to the material culture of charity in the past through object-based learning (OBL) and assessment includes writing an &lsquo;object report&rsquo; as well as a standard essay.</p>",

This module will restrict itself to the following, specific objectives: Firstly, to assess the nature of Judaism and Jewish life in the period when Christianity arose. This will involve the study of various Jewish groups that were active in this period, such as Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, as well as the study of post-Biblical Jewish literature including the Dead Sea scrolls. Students will gain an appreciation of the complexity of Judaism and its importance in ancient society. Secondly, to assess the nature of early Christianity in relation to Judaism, and to discuss whether, when, and how, Christianity &#39;parted ways&#39; from Judaism. Particular attention will be given to Jesus, Paul, and their successors&#39; attitudes to the Jewish people, Jewish law, and Judaism. Thirdly, to consider Jewish-Christian relations, Christian attitudes to Judaism, and Jewish attitudes to Christianity, in the first few centuries of the Common Era.

Focusing especially on three cult sites in the Middle Ages - Jerusalem, Santiago de Compostela and Canterbury - we will see how imagery associated with saintly bodies adapts and morphs to suit the needs of different times and places. Looking at this imagery through the prism of categories such as translation, liminality, the simulacrum and the souvenir, the module asks how modern critical frameworks can reconnect us with the potency of the relic. As well as considering reliquaries and cult statues, we will explore such phenomena as mappaemundi or world maps, virtual or armchair pilgrimage, and replica buildings designed to &#39;translate&#39; sites associated with the Holy Land from East to West. At the end of the module we will also consider the afterlife of the relic. Why, in some parts of Europe, did the power of saintly remains seemingly diminish? Where and how has it re-emerged?</div>",

Across the centuries there have been many attempts to answer these and other questions surrounding the still-mysterious state of sleep. This course is designed to explore the different ways sleeping and dreaming have been understood in the past, both distant and recent. What is the relation between the physical and mental aspects of sleep; why do some cultures see dreams as true, some see them as false, and other see them as the gateway to the unconscious? We discuss historical understandings of the physiology of sleep, the interpretations of dreams, the material culture of resting, the drugs that produce artificial sleep, and the ways sleeping and dreaming have been used in art, literature and film. The module is designed to familiarise students with the questions and literature in the history of sleep, including medical and psychological materials. The class will follow a seminar-based model, requiring students to read the materials critically and discuss the materials in class. As an advanced course, it is also intended to increase the student&rsquo;s analytical, research and writing skills. The research essay requires students to gather the primary and secondary literature on a topic, synthesise the material and hone their abilities at making a sustained argument.</p>",

We will critically examine the idea that the world can be understood as composed of the rich, industrialised &ldquo;developed&rdquo; countries (or global &ldquo;North&rdquo;) and the poorer &ldquo;majority world&rdquo; (or global &ldquo;South&rdquo;), and &ndash; using a critical approach to the processes of development &ndash; we will emphasize the interaction of politics with society, culture and economics.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThis module deals with the empirical reality, theory, and current governance problems of development, poverty, and inequality. Specifically, throughout the course we will investigate the influence of colonialism, state capacity, regime type, war and conflict, accountability, social structures (ethnicity and gender), and corruption on economic development. This module engages with both economic theory regarding development and political science research that highlights the challenges to implementing the policies that would lead to economic development. The main objective of the moudle is to introduce students to the main debates in the political economic of development field and the various strategies to promote development. Over the duration of the module, students will learn to critically apply different theoretical perspectives on development to a range of contemporary substantive issues that are relevant to international public policy and development.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThe module will begin with an introduction to the main challenges to development from a variety of theoretical perspectives. We will then focus on the role of institutions and policy in promoting and hindering economic development. The module will then explore the relationship between ethnic diversity and gender and economic development and the ways in which war and development influence each other. The last two weeks of the module will then investigate the role of aid and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in promoting economic development.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tPlease note that POLS0021 is an advanced Political Science module.

The second main focus of the course will be on the religion of the Greek city-state of the classical period and its various aspects, such as priesthoods and sacrifices, sanctuaries and festivals, channels of communication with the divine sphere (seers, oracles, dreams), and hero cult.

				"ModuleInstanceDescription": "<p>\n\t<strong>Module information</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe unifying topic of &ldquo;Introduction to Human Genetics&rdquo; is how genes and their interactions, either with other genes or with the environment, make us what we are. When these interactions break down genetic disease may result, and it is often through these genetic mistakes that we are able to work out what happens in the normal situation. The module will introduce you to the subject of human genetics, enable you to appreciate the implications of genetic research for society and provide a basis for more advanced studies.&nbsp;At the end of the module, you should be able to understand and critically evaluate scientific studies in human genetics, whether reported in scientific journals or in the lay press.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe introductory lectures will remind you how Mendelian rules of inheritance can be applied to human families but that this is not always straightforward to interpret. Not all traits are inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion and the methods by which quantitative and multifactorial traits are studied will be introduced in the second half of the course.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe lectures on pedigrees are followed by a section on cytogenetics that covers the study of chromosomes and their abnormalities, followed by lectures on molecular genetics. The module continues with the study of inborn errors of metabolism and with the nature and origin of human genetic variation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second half of the module focuses on genetic mapping techniques which culminated in the multi-billion dollar human genome project. Within these lectures we examine gene mapping tools for both monogenic and polygenic diseases with examples that are interesting both for their own sake but also as examples of the results obtained using the molecular methods discussed earlier.&nbsp; The human genome project has now moved on from the study of the human DNA sequence to the study of variation between individuals and populations. The existence of genetic variation, polymorphism, has been known for many years and we look at this both from a historical perspective as well as considering how this is of interest to modern genetics, medicine and to the pharmaceutical industry. The module will cover the study of human populations and human origins and it will include discussions on the topic of bioethics through a debate.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>",

				"ModuleInstanceDescription": "<p>\n\tThe purpose of PHAY 0012 is to learn about the clinical importance of the formulation sciences and pharmaceutical processing.&nbsp; Clinically registered medicines will be used to exemplify concepts. To have impact, the formulation sciences requires knowledge of the clinical end point.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tPharmaceutical Biotechnology is covered during semester 1. Therapeutic proteins, polypeptides and vaccines have become widely, and in many cases routinely used since the advent of the biotechnology era (ca 1980). The vast majority of these medicines require parenteral administration. The non-covalent interactions of therapeutic proteins define a tertiary (3-dimensional) structure which must be maintained to be biologically active.</p>\n<p>\n\tMaintaining the tertiary structure throughout the manufacture, formulation, transport, storage and use of therapeutic proteins is often difficult. Because parenteral administration is necessary, clearance is also often rapid and must be optimised. The pharmaceutical sciences are critical for transforming biotechnologically derived actives into viable and prac&shy;tical medicines.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring Semester 2 we will examine other important facets of the formulation sciences. Complex formulations of low molecular weight actives or in some cases, actives that do not have a defined structure have been developed. Often these actives are poorly soluble, but one important consideration is these actives are often characterised by a narrow therapeutic window. Again the pharmaceutical sciences are critical in transforming such actives into useful medicines and while more traditional dosage forms continue to be developed, the use of drug eluting, implantable dosage forms, e.g. microspheres or injectable implants is also important to improve efficacy and patient compliance. During Semester 2 of the module there will be considerable emphasis on clinical pharmaceutics where clinically registered medicines will be used as examples to illustrate how the pharmaceutical sciences can influence clinical outcome. An emphasis of the importance of clinical pharmaceutics provides the framework to show how knowledge of the underlying science of medicines is important in the day-to-day provision and use of medicines. We will also discuss the development of generic medicines in the context of protein therapeutics, complex formulations and narrow therapeutic index drugs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother general topic of this module relates to how new medicines and treatments are evolving. There is much more awareness about the need to ensure there is widespread access for both improved versions of existing medicines and new medicines. The pharmaceutical sciences can contribute to the increased access of medicines by making medicines more cost-effective and more practical to use (e.g. provision of ready to use dosage forms, no need for a cold chain). The pharmaceutical sciences play an important part in the lifecycle management of medicines. Life cycle management seeks to increase patient benefit, often by developing an improved version of a medicine that may be easier to administer or has a longer duration of action.&nbsp; As exemplified in the coursework and in some of the lectures, the need to consider a holistic perspective about healthcare will be encouraged.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>",

The coursework forms an important part of the module and is designed to illustrate specific cellular processes and techniques in greater detail.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Module information</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tRunning in Term 1 CELL0009 is a broad-based cell biology module that aims to introduce students who have taken cell or molecular biology in Year 1 (BIOC0001 and or CELL0007/CELL0008/BIOS0005) to a wide range of topics related to the biological functioning of eukaryotic cells. &nbsp;It will prepare you for more specialised modules in the 3<sup>rd</sup> year. &nbsp;Through lectures, online practical assignments in the form of Moodle quizzes and a dry lab on cell biology microscopy data interpretation this module will provide up-to-date coverage of a broad range of topics in eukaryotic cell biology. &nbsp;Coursework is an important part of your study and is designed to illustrate specific cellular processes and techniques in more detail, to support and enhance the lectures.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Indicative lecture topics</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe following is a typical example of topics; precise contents in any given year of study may change with module updates and development:-</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tcell structure and function,</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tfunction of organelles and intracellular compartmentalisation,</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\torganelle biogenesis and protein/membrane trafficking (including the transport of proteins to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum,</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tGolgi apparatus, lysosomes, peroxisomes, mitochondria, chloroplast, secretory vesicles, plasma membrane, as well as processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis),</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tstructure and function of biological membranes,</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tstructure and function of the cytoskeleton (including microtubules, microfilaments etc.),</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tcell division and the cell cycle,</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\texperimental methods used in cell biology (including tissue culture, microscopy, and protein expression and analysis techniques),</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tcell specialization and differentiation,</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tmulticellular life (including stem cells, control of cell growth and programmed cell death).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Module Notes</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tStudents should note that this module does not specifically cover signalling and signal transduction. For detailed coverage in this area, students are recommended to take CELL0010. &nbsp;To combine the cell biology of CELL0009 and the cell signalling of CELL0010 students should take course CELL0011 (registration for both CELL0009 and CELL0010 independently will not be permitted). &nbsp;Note, CELL0011 is popular and additional places available beyond students for whom it is compulsory (listed, below) are limited. &nbsp;Note if you are a student on BioMedSci stream 5 (Cells and Molecules) or the Cell Biology stream of Natural Sciences you need to register (compulsory) for CELL0011.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis module is co-taught with CELL0011. &nbsp;Places are limited to a combined total of 144 (CELL0011 is capped at 96, so typically the cap for CELL0009 is 48). &nbsp;CELL0009 is an option for students on Biosciences and Natural Sciences programmes and may be taken as an elective by students (including affiliate students) on other degree programmes. &nbsp;In the event of module over-subscription, the module may not be available as an elective.</p>",
