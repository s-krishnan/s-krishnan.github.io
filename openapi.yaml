    # Introduction

    Welcome to the reference for the UCL Academic REST API!

    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST_API" target="_blank">REST</a> is a web-service protocol that lends itself to rapid development by using everyday HTTP and JSON, XML technology.


    The UCL Academic REST API provides a broad set of operations and resources that:

      * Enable Web integration from the website.
      * Support self-service subscriber sign-ups and account management (future).
      * Enable manipulation of most objects in the Academic Object Model.

    ## Access to the API

      You can access the UCL Academic REST API via one of the following endpoints:

    | Environment              | Base URL for REST Endpoints |

    |-------------------------|-------------------------|

    |Production | https://api.ucl.ac.uk/AcademicModule   |

    |UAT    | https://api.ucl.ac.uk/AcademicModule|

    |Performance Test | TBC |


    The Production endpoint provides access to the live data. UAT tenants are a good place to test code without affecting real-world data. If you would like UCL to provision an UAT tenant for you, contact API service owner for assistance.

    # Authentication

     Authentication detail 

    # Requests and Responses


    ## BDO IDs 

    As a general rule, pass BDOid to select / update / delete single resource in academic REST APIs  


    ## HTTP Request Body


    Most of the parameters and data accompanying your requests will be contained in the body of the HTTP request. 


    The UCL Academic REST API accepts JSON, XML in the HTTP request body. No other data format (e.g., SOAP, RSS, TEXT) is supported.


    ## Testing a Request


    Use a third party client, such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se "curl"), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com "Postman"), or [Advanced REST Client](https://advancedrestclient.com "Advanced REST Client"), to test the UCL Academic REST API.


    You can test the UCL Academic REST API for any enviornment as long as you have sufficient access. If connecting to Production, bear in mind that you are working with your live production data, not sample data or test data.

      Timeout Limit

    If a request does not complete within 120 seconds, the request times out and API platform returns a Gateway Timeout error.


    ## Response codes and errors

     Response codes indicate success or failure of data processing. Status codes from the 2XX range indicate that request has been accepted. If the returned code is from the 4XX range then it reveals either problem with the request or unability to discover new data.  

    | Response Code              | Description|
      |-------------------------|----|
      |200                   | Invalid values / Bad Request  |
      |400                   | Unauthorized. It is usally caused by using a wrong API key or do not using one at all.  |
      |401                   | Too many requests (plase see Rate limits below)  |
      |411                   | Bad request  |
      |405                   | The request was successful  |
      |500                   | Internal Server Error. Please contact API team  |

       

    # API Rate Limits


    API platform enforces client-level, Rate limiting of the standard API is primarily on a  per-user basis — or more accurately described, per user access token. If a method allows for X requests per rate limit   window, then it allows X requests per window per access token.  
     See below for more information.
     ##  HTTP Headers and Response Codes 
     Use the HTTP headers in order to understand where the application is at for a given rate limit,  on the method that was just utilized. 
      *	`x-rate-limit-limit:`  the rate limit ceiling for that given endpoint, indicates how many calls  your application may make per time window. This time window is currently 60 seconds for most the resources,  but for the most reliable code you should not assume this is the case - use the X-Rate-Limit-Reset header instead. 
      *   `x-rate-limit-remaining:`  the number of requests left for the current time window 
      *   `x-rate-limit-reset:`  the remaining window before the rate limit resets, in UTC 
      [epoch seconds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) 
      When an application exceeds the rate limit for a given API endpoint, the API will return a   [HTTP 429 “Too Many Requests”](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585)  response code,    and the following error will be returned in the response body 
      '{ "errors": [ { "code": 88, "message": "Rate limit exceeded" } ] }' 
      and the following response header  `Retry-After: `the remaining window before the rate limit resets, in UTC  [epoch seconds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)

    # Pagination


    When retrieving information (using GET methods), the optional `skip` and 'limit' query parameters sets the stating record and maximum number of record to return in a response. The maximum is `10`; larger values are treated as `10`. If this value is empty or invalid, 'skip' typically defaults to `0` and 'limit' defaults to 10.


    The default value for the maximum number of rows retrieved can be overridden at the method level.


    If more rows are available, the response will the following pagination detail ### Pagination property in the main Body:  

        {  
            "Modules":{  
              "Module":[  
                {  
                  "ModuleIdentifier": .......  
                  ......................  
                }

                  "offset": "10",  
                  "limit": "10",  
                }  
              ]  
           }  



     

    ## Array Size


    For data items that are not paginated, the REST API supports arrays of up to 50 rows.  


    # API Versions


    The Academic REST  API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that UCL Academic REST API changes are backward compatible. This API uses a major and minor version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the API.


    ## Major Version


    The major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. Currently, Academic API only supports the **v1** major version. For example, `POST https://TBC/v1`.


    ## Minor Version


    Academic API uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to replace it. 


    Some fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request header to process without an error. 


    If a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions.  


    If you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported, API will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we note that in the field description.


    You only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `minor-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request call. The `minor-version` parameter is case sensitive.


    For all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not specified in the request header, API will use the minimum minor version of the REST API to avoid breaking your integration. 


    ### Minor Version History


    The supported minor versions are not serial. This section documents the changes made to each UCL Academic REST API minor version.


    The following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a UCL Academic REST API minor version.


    | Fields         | Minor Version      | REST Methods    | Description |

    |:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|
     | TBC | TBC  | TBC|TBC|

                            	What happens during sleep? Why do we dream? Across the centuries there have been many attempts to answer these and other questions surrounding the still-mysterious state of sleep. This course is designed to explore the different ways sleeping and dreaming have been understood in the past, both distant and recent. What is the relation between the physical and mental aspects of sleep; why do some cultures see dreams as true, some see them as false, and other see them as the gateway to the unconscious? We discuss historical understandings of the physiology of sleep, the interpretations of dreams, the material culture of resting, the drugs that produce artificial sleep, and the ways sleeping and dreaming have been used in art, literature and film. The module is designed to familiarise students with the questions and literature in the history of sleep, including medical and psychological materials. The class will follow a seminar-based model, requiring students to read the materials critically and discuss the materials in class. As an advanced course, it is also intended to increase the student&rsquo;s analytical, research and writing skills. The research essay requires students to gather the primary and secondary literature on a topic, synthesise the material and hone their abilities at making a sustained argument.</p>

                            	This module is designed to analyse and question the recurring argument in modern society which claims that science and religion are and have always been in conflict with one another. The belief that there are fundamental and irreconcilable differences between these two systems and the ways they view the world actually has a much more recent history than is generally assumed, arising primarily out of the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries. This module explores the ways in which people in different cultures and different time periods have attempted to navigate between naturalistic and faith-based understandings of the world we inhabit. We will look at several cultures including the Christian, Islamic and Chinese traditions, as well as various themes such as cosmology, Darwinism and medicine.</p>

                            	This module allows participants to considering the work they may have done in a recent non-accredited CPD or to study something of their own interest.<br />
                            	A series of ten activities supports participants in choosing and focusing engagement with an idea or concept. The module then moves on to think about each participant as a learner and what hinders learning, before returning to the investigation to support learners in finding their own readings in the field of study &ndash; the course team will also share some to start participants going!<br />
                            	The module is taught online and can be taken in either the Autumn term, Spring term and Summer term in 2019-20.</p>

                            	<em>Fundamentals of Biology</em> is designed to introduce students with a primary interest in whole organism biology (including Genetics, Human Genetics, Zoology, Biodiversity and Conservation) to fundamental chemical principles and experimental approaches to studying how they underpin living systems. If you have already completed A level Chemistry or equivalent, the module will provide you with the opportunity to apply your knowledge in a specifically biological framework. &nbsp;You will learn to assess and present evidence from a variety of sources through group projects, data analysis and presentations.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>
                            	Each section of the module will introduce you to a specific topic in biology before going on to explore the underlying chemical principles. As well as lectures you will attend workshops that will develop your ability to read research papers critically and tutorials to go through chemistry problems in small groups. Instead of an unseen examination in term 3, you will carry out either a field or lab-based research project, which will be written up in the form of a group poster presentation and short (individual) paper. If you choose to do a field project this will be carried out at 4-day field course at Blakeney Point, Norfolk.&nbsp;</p>

                    <ModuleInstanceDescription>&lt;p&gt; What happens during
                    sleep? Why do we dream? Across the centuries there have been
                    many attempts to answer these and other questions
                    surrounding the still-mysterious state of sleep. This course
                    is designed to explore the different ways sleeping and
                    dreaming have been understood in the past, both distant and
                    recent. What is the relation between the physical and mental
                    aspects of sleep; why do some cultures see dreams as true,
                    some see them as false, and other see them as the gateway to
                    the unconscious? We discuss historical understandings of the
                    physiology of sleep, the interpretations of dreams, the
                    material culture of resting, the drugs that produce
                    artificial sleep, and the ways sleeping and dreaming have
                    been used in art, literature and film. The module is
                    designed to familiarise students with the questions and
                    literature in the history of sleep, including medical and
                    psychological materials. The class will follow a
                    seminar-based model, requiring students to read the
                    materials critically and discuss the materials in class. As
                    an advanced course, it is also intended to increase the
                    student&amp;rsquo;s analytical, research and writing skills.
                    The research essay requires students to gather the primary
                    and secondary literature on a topic, synthesise the material
                    and hone their abilities at making a sustained
                    argument.&lt;/p&gt; </ModuleInstanceDescription>

                    <ModuleInstanceDescription>&lt;p&gt; This module is designed
                    to analyse and question the recurring argument in modern
                    society which claims that science and religion are and have
                    always been in conflict with one another. The belief that
                    there are fundamental and irreconcilable differences between
                    these two systems and the ways they view the world actually
                    has a much more recent history than is generally assumed,
                    arising primarily out of the late nineteenth and first half
                    of the twentieth centuries. This module explores the ways in
                    which people in different cultures and different time
                    periods have attempted to navigate between naturalistic and
                    faith-based understandings of the world we inhabit. We will
                    look at several cultures including the Christian, Islamic
                    and Chinese traditions, as well as various themes such as
                    cosmology, Darwinism and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <ModuleInstanceDescription>&lt;p&gt; This module allows
                    participants to considering the work they may have done in a
                    recent non-accredited CPD or to study something of their own
                    interest.&lt;br /&gt; A series of ten activities supports
                    participants in choosing and focusing engagement with an
                    idea or concept. The module then moves on to think about
                    each participant as a learner and what hinders learning,
                    before returning to the investigation to support learners in
                    finding their own readings in the field of study &amp;ndash;
                    the course team will also share some to start participants
                    going!&lt;br /&gt; The module is taught online and can be
                    taken in either the Autumn term, Spring term and Summer term
                    in 2019-20.&lt;/p&gt; </ModuleInstanceDescription>

                              	The purpose of PHAY 0012 is to learn about the clinical importance of the formulation sciences and pharmaceutical processing.&nbsp; Clinically registered medicines will be used to exemplify concepts. To have impact, the formulation sciences requires knowledge of the clinical end point.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p>
                              	Pharmaceutical Biotechnology is covered during semester 1. Therapeutic proteins, polypeptides and vaccines have become widely, and in many cases routinely used since the advent of the biotechnology era (ca 1980). The vast majority of these medicines require parenteral administration. The non-covalent interactions of therapeutic proteins define a tertiary (3-dimensional) structure which must be maintained to be biologically active.</p>
                              <p>
                              	Maintaining the tertiary structure throughout the manufacture, formulation, transport, storage and use of therapeutic proteins is often difficult. Because parenteral administration is necessary, clearance is also often rapid and must be optimised. The pharmaceutical sciences are critical for transforming biotechnologically derived actives into viable and prac&shy;tical medicines.</p>
                              <p>
                              	During Semester 2 we will examine other important facets of the formulation sciences. Complex formulations of low molecular weight actives or in some cases, actives that do not have a defined structure have been developed. Often these actives are poorly soluble, but one important consideration is these actives are often characterised by a narrow therapeutic window. Again the pharmaceutical sciences are critical in transforming such actives into useful medicines and while more traditional dosage forms continue to be developed, the use of drug eluting, implantable dosage forms, e.g. microspheres or injectable implants is also important to improve efficacy and patient compliance. During Semester 2 of the module there will be considerable emphasis on clinical pharmaceutics where clinically registered medicines will be used as examples to illustrate how the pharmaceutical sciences can influence clinical outcome. An emphasis of the importance of clinical pharmaceutics provides the framework to show how knowledge of the underlying science of medicines is important in the day-to-day provision and use of medicines. We will also discuss the development of generic medicines in the context of protein therapeutics, complex formulations and narrow therapeutic index drugs.</p>
                              <p>
                              	Another general topic of this module relates to how new medicines and treatments are evolving. There is much more awareness about the need to ensure there is widespread access for both improved versions of existing medicines and new medicines. The pharmaceutical sciences can contribute to the increased access of medicines by making medicines more cost-effective and more practical to use (e.g. provision of ready to use dosage forms, no need for a cold chain). The pharmaceutical sciences play an important part in the lifecycle management of medicines. Life cycle management seeks to increase patient benefit, often by developing an improved version of a medicine that may be easier to administer or has a longer duration of action.&nbsp; As exemplified in the coursework and in some of the lectures, the need to consider a holistic perspective about healthcare will be encouraged.</p>

                              	Saints were the celebrities of medieval Europe. From the miracles they worked to the rituals and journeys they inspired, holy bodies were invested with immense spiritual and political power. Relics were also hugely important as a source of aesthetic inspiration. This module explores art and architecture associated with physical remains of saints. Focusing especially on three cult sites in the Middle Ages - Jerusalem, Santiago de Compostela and Canterbury - we will see how imagery associated with saintly bodies adapts and morphs to suit the needs of different times and places. Looking at this imagery through the prism of categories such as translation, liminality, the simulacrum and the souvenir, the module asks how modern critical frameworks can reconnect us with the potency of the relic. As well as considering reliquaries and cult statues, we will explore such phenomena as mappaemundi or world maps, virtual or armchair pilgrimage, and replica buildings designed to &#39;translate&#39; sites associated with the Holy Land from East to West. At the end of the module we will also consider the afterlife of the relic. Why, in some parts of Europe, did the power of saintly remains seemingly diminish? Where and how has it re-emerged?</div>

                              	&ldquo;Life on Earth&rdquo; will begin by discussing the evidence for the emergence of life, the origins of the solar system and the conditions under which life emerged and the origin of eukaryotic cells. The theory behind reconstructing trees of evolutionary relatedness will be introduced and patterns of relatedness in the living world discussed, ranging from familiar creatures to new and bizarre forms being discovered in the depths of the oceans and under the earth&rsquo;s surface. All main branches of life will be covered with a particular focus on the evolution of plants and their importance to global biodiversity and on the many groups of invertebrates and vertebrates including ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

At the end of the module you should be familiar with the diversity of living organisms; with classification of the living world; with the origins and history of life; and with the fundamental body plans of major groups of animals. You will have a solid grounding in modern ideas of the history of evolution of life on earth and understand the link between the evolution of developmental processes and the evolution of adult morphology.</p>

In this way, they will gain an understanding of concepts and theories produced by these sources. They will also concentrate on primary materials and develop the ability to read texts independently, to manage their own learning, to communicate ideas orally and in writing and to gather, analyze and synthesize data. Teamwork and independent thinking will also be strongly encouraged in order to enable student development and achievement.</p>

                              	The &#39;West&#39; has long occupied a privileged place in U.S. geopolitics. Since the first decades of the nineteenth century, this region has heralded both the success and demise of the American experiment. This module considers the ways in which American visual culture (painting, photography, film, and city planning) has pictured, produced, critiqued and mythologized this geography. Central to our discussion of the spatial politics of empire building will be the particular importance of the figure of the &#39;frontier&#39; in American geopolitics. Why, we will ask, has the American frontier remained open-ended and ill-defined for the last two centuries? Does it mark a specific place? Is it a figure of modernity? As will become evident throughout the module, these questions were as central to the formation of the nation as they are today. Topics for discussion will include the organization of the US border with Mexico, immigration, land rights and gun control.</div>

                              	In the past decades, increasing recognition has been given to the Jewish origins of Christianity and the Jewish context in which Christianity was formed. The scope and implications of this topic are wide. This module will restrict itself to the following, specific objectives: Firstly, to assess the nature of Judaism and Jewish life in the period when Christianity arose. This will involve the study of various Jewish groups that were active in this period, such as Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, as well as the study of post-Biblical Jewish literature including the Dead Sea scrolls. Students will gain an appreciation of the complexity of Judaism and its importance in ancient society. Secondly, to assess the nature of early Christianity in relation to Judaism, and to discuss whether, when, and how, Christianity &#39;parted ways&#39; from Judaism. Particular attention will be given to Jesus, Paul, and their successors&#39; attitudes to the Jewish people, Jewish law, and Judaism. Thirdly, to consider Jewish-Christian relations, Christian attitudes to Judaism, and Jewish attitudes to Christianity, in the first few centuries of the Common Era. Admission to this module is open to students of all backgrounds and disciplines. All texts will be studied in translation.</div>

                              	This module examines the history of European colonialism in Sub-Saharan Africa from the late nineteenth century to the 1960s. It introduces a range of important debates on the nature of colonial rule, its impact on African societies and economies and its consequences for understanding contemporary Africa. Through a detailed analysis of a number of case studies, the module examines the diverse forms taken by colonialism and the unevenness of its political, economic and social effects. It engages with debates on the production of &lsquo;colonial knowledge&rsquo; and on the cultural dimensions of colonial rule and it examines the work of a range of African thinkers of the colonial period. Amongst other topics, we will examine the nature of colonial legal and political structures, the role of religion, the impact of European settlers, changing gender relations and the emergence of nationalist thinking.</div>

                              	Financial Accounting is concerned with accounting for the financial transactions and activities of a business in a particular financial period, and building the financial story of that period through the subsequent construction and publication of core financial statements: Balance Sheets, Income Statements, and Cash Flow Statements. In so doing it explains why profit and cash measurements of the same transactions and activities differ, and how Income Statements and Cash Flow Statements are constructed. The Accounting Equation of Assets = Liabilities is applied to the construction of the Balance Sheet. Contextually issues in revenue recognition and expense identification, and in the valuation of assets and liabilties are explored. The module shows students how to calculate financial ratios toanalyse and interpret the core financial statements to gain insights into financial health and performance, insights managers and other interested stakeholders, especially shareholders, are particularly interested in. The module also explores core aspects of Corporate Governanceand their implications for corporate reporting.</div>

                              	How can we, and how should we, write the history of sex and sexuality? How did the experiences of men or women who experienced sexual desire for members of the same sex change over the course of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries? When did the idea of a homosexual, gay, lesbian, or queer identity appear in Britain? What was the role of legal changes (all homosexual acts between men in public or private were criminalised between 1885 and 1967) and of scientific knowledge in shaping identities and practices? These are the questions this module sets out to answer. It looks at legal changes relating to homosexuality and the development of scientific thinking on the subject. It also looks at changing queer subcultures, sexual practices, and sexual identities in Britain from the 1880s to the 1980s, asking how sexual practices related to sexual identities, and charting the development of self-conscious and proud LGBTQ+ identities.</p>

                              	This course offers students an overview of selective aspects of the history of twentieth-century London, set within the wider context of twentieth-century British history and politics, imperial history and decolonization. This is not a comprehensive and detailed history of the city itself; rather, London as a &lsquo;imperial metropole&rsquo; is used as a lens through which to explore broader questions about changing collective identities such as Englishness, Britishness, and the imperial. Case studies may include efforts to create &lsquo;imperial architecture&rsquo; in London c. 1900; intellectuals and imperialism in late Edwardian Bloomsbury; Americanisation in the 1920s &lsquo;jazz age&rsquo;; Cable Street and the anti-fascist struggle; the Blitz and its trans-Atlantic dimensions; and post-war &lsquo;New Commonwealth&rsquo; immigration in places such as Brixton and Notting Hill.</p>

                              	The unifying topic of &ldquo;Introduction to Human Genetics&rdquo; is how genes and their interactions, either with other genes or with the environment, make us what we are. When these interactions break down genetic disease may result, and it is often through these genetic mistakes that we are able to work out what happens in the normal situation. The module will introduce you to the subject of human genetics, enable you to appreciate the implications of genetic research for society and provide a basis for more advanced studies.&nbsp;At the end of the module, you should be able to understand and critically evaluate scientific studies in human genetics, whether reported in scientific journals or in the lay press.</p>
                              <p>
                              	The introductory lectures will remind you how Mendelian rules of inheritance can be applied to human families but that this is not always straightforward to interpret. Not all traits are inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion and the methods by which quantitative and multifactorial traits are studied will be introduced in the second half of the course.</p>
                              <p>
                              	The lectures on pedigrees are followed by a section on cytogenetics that covers the study of chromosomes and their abnormalities, followed by lectures on molecular genetics. The module continues with the study of inborn errors of metabolism and with the nature and origin of human genetic variation.</p>
                              <p>
                              	The second half of the module focuses on genetic mapping techniques which culminated in the multi-billion dollar human genome project. Within these lectures we examine gene mapping tools for both monogenic and polygenic diseases with examples that are interesting both for their own sake but also as examples of the results obtained using the molecular methods discussed earlier.&nbsp; The human genome project has now moved on from the study of the human DNA sequence to the study of variation between individuals and populations. The existence of genetic variation, polymorphism, has been known for many years and we look at this both from a historical perspective as well as considering how this is of interest to modern genetics, medicine and to the pharmaceutical industry. The module will cover the study of human populations and human origins and it will include discussions on the topic of bioethics through a debate.</p>

It will provide key illustrations of different responses to classical cultures in action and demonstrate how later cultures have viewed and made use of the classical world from their own historically situated standpoint. It also aims to equip students with the tools for further research in the reception of the classical world by developing their critical and conceptual understanding in this field. The module is taught by a range of experts in classical reception. It addresses theory, the history of reception (from within antiquity to the twenty-first century, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean). The module also explores the engagements of classical antiquity throughout the centuries with issues of gender, class, race, politics and national identity.</p>

                              	In term 1, &lsquo;reception studies&rsquo;&nbsp;and its theoretical approaches are introduced. Case studies of reception are then explored within antiquity and beyond up to the Renaissance, with a focus mainly on literary reception. In term 2, case studies of reception are explored from the Renaissance up to the present day,&nbsp;with&nbsp;an emphasis on material culture, art, museums, performance, film and political thought (and includes tours of the Petrie and the British Museums). MA Reception students are required to take the whole module (40 credits). Other MA students may take the whole module or just term 1 as a half module.</p>

                              	This module examines the interplay between values and social sciences. It asks both how the social sciences are or should be influenced by values and how moral or political philosophy should incorporate the findings of the social sciences. The course has two overall aims: first, to encourage critical reflection on the methodology of the social sciences and, second, to explore the relationship between normative philosophy and the social sciences.</div>

                              	This module will address questions including: Are the social sciences inevitably more value-laden than the natural sciences? Should citizens decide what gets researched? Can there be moral reasons for social scientists to refrain from researching particular topics or communicating their results? What can and should moral and political philosophy learn from the social sciences? What should the relation between political philosophy and political science be like?</div>

                              	This course is a continuation of HPSC0004 Philosophy of Science, intended for students that have completed that course or studied a similar introduction to philosophy of science elsewhere. The course explores some central debates in general philosophy of science, including: arguments, realism and antirealism about scientific theories, scientific explanation, laws of nature, reductionism and the unity of science. After this course you should possess a fairly well-rounded view of the field, as well as a set of skills that will allow you to work further on your own.</p>

                              	This module is designed to analyse and question the recurring argument in modern society which claims that science and religion are and have always been in conflict with one another. The belief that there are fundamental and irreconcilable differences between these two systems and the ways they view the world actually has a much more recent history than is generally assumed, arising primarily out of the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries. This module explores the ways in which people in different cultures and different time periods have attempted to navigate between naturalistic and faith-based understandings of the world we inhabit. We will look at several cultures including the Christian, Islamic and Chinese traditions, as well as various themes such as cosmology, Darwinism and medicine.</p>

Issues examined will include the origins and development of astronomy, theories of the origin of the universe and of the nature of the universe, ideas of humanity&rsquo;s place in the cosmos. The overall aim of the module is to give a working knowledge of astronomy and cosmology from the Babylonians to the present. The course is divided into two roughly equal elements: (a) ancient and classical astronomy and cosmology to Einstein, and (b) modern astronomy and cosmology after Einstein. The course will rasie historical, technical and philosophical questions. By the end of the course students will have acquired: (1) A working knowledge of the history of astronomy and cosmology, (2) An appreciation of the development of views on the nature of space and time, (3) An appreciation of debates about man&rsquo;s place in the cosmos, (4) A basic technical knowledge of major ancient and modern theories, and (5) A knowledge of the philosophical principles underpinning cosmology and cosmogony.</p>

                              	This is an introductory module in the philosophy of science. The course is divided into two parts: (1) the epistemology of science and (2) the metaphysics of science. The first part of the course will focus on several central problems regarding the nature of scientific knowledge: how do scientists know if current scientific theories are true? Is science progressive? How do scientists test their theories and how are theories confirmed? Can science and pseudoscience be distinguished? How are sciences distinguished from one another? These questions will be discussed in the light of examples from science. During the course of discussing these problems, you will study some of the major positions that have been taken about scientific knowledge both in the history of philosophy and in the 20th century: Inductivism (Bacon), Logical Empiricism (Ayer and Quine), Falsificationism (Popper), Incommensurability (Kuhn) and Relativism (Feyerabend). What does it mean if more than two theories are consistent with the evidence (Quine/Duhem)? Philosophy of Science 1 will provide you with the background knowledge that you will need for other Philosophy courses that you will take in later years. You do not need prior knowledge of philosophy or science to do this course.</p>

                              	What happens during sleep? Why do we dream? Across the centuries there have been many attempts to answer these and other questions surrounding the still-mysterious state of sleep. This course is designed to explore the different ways sleeping and dreaming have been understood in the past, both distant and recent. What is the relation between the physical and mental aspects of sleep; why do some cultures see dreams as true, some see them as false, and other see them as the gateway to the unconscious? We discuss historical understandings of the physiology of sleep, the interpretations of dreams, the material culture of resting, the drugs that produce artificial sleep, and the ways sleeping and dreaming have been used in art, literature and film. The module is designed to familiarise students with the questions and literature in the history of sleep, including medical and psychological materials. The class will follow a seminar-based model, requiring students to read the materials critically and discuss the materials in class. As an advanced course, it is also intended to increase the student&rsquo;s analytical, research and writing skills. The research essay requires students to gather the primary and secondary literature on a topic, synthesise the material and hone their abilities at making a sustained argument.</p>

                              	This module focuses on the many different ways in which publics engage with science in face-to-face contexts. Teaching will particularly focus on direct interactions within governance and policy settings, museums and other more informal activities, and on how specific public groups, such as patient and citizen groups get involved, and engage with, scientific and medical research. Group projects will develop a practical understanding of how to organize such activities, alongside which students will critically reflect on the theory and context that underpins such activities such as models of publics and audiences, rationales for engagement in different contexts and the wider policy contexts and historical trends.</p>

                              	The role of voluntary organisations has been vital to social and political life throughout the history of modern Britain. Across the fields of social welfare, health, education/youth work, international development and humanitarian aid, non-governmental organisations have made significant contributions. The module introduces students to the latest research and debates, exploring change from challenges to Victorian and Edwardian models of philanthropy during and after the First World War to the age of the big international NGO in the 1980s. It highlights the importance of voluntary action for ordinary people &ndash; particularly women and young people &ndash; across the twentieth century, and promotes an enhanced understanding of the voluntary sector today. Drawing extensively on primary source material, the module is taught through 10 activity-based seminars. In particular, students are introduced to the material culture of charity in the past through object-based learning (OBL) and assessment includes writing an &lsquo;object report&rsquo; as well as a standard essay.</p>

                              	Systematic reviews use robust methods to identify and examine existing research reports on a given topic and to produce accessible, reliable and useful syntheses or maps of research, often for policy or practice audiences. Students will learn the principles underlying all systematic reviews, and the ways that they vary &ndash; from different types of research question through to methods for synthesising both quantitative and qualitative findings. Students will apply tools that aid review production and apply methods to formulate review questions, identify research, classify and appraise studies, and plan syntheses of findings. They will apply their learning so as to critically appraise existing review reports. Students participate in workshops in a classroom at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE) or at a distance via Moodle, our virtual learning environment. Workshops will be recorded and made available on Moodle. All students will be expected to engage in additional individual and group activities online.</p>

                              	This interdisciplinary module will examine the development of racial and ethnic thought, xenophobia, and related forms of exclusion in Africa from the nineteenth century to the present day. Among many topics, students in this module will examine the colonial construction of the &ldquo;native,&rdquo; intersections between race and gender under colonialism, and debates over autochthony and citizenship in postcolonial Africa. Students will also consider how new scholarship on race and slavery in Islamic Africa, racialization and sexuality under colonialism, and nativism in independent Africa is reshaping the field of African Studies. Questioning assumptions about Africa as a non-racialized space or a site of primordial ethnicity, this course will situate the study of ethnic and racial thought on the continent within broader scholarly debates across various disciplines.</p>

                              	Through the lens of social and intellectual histories of empire in the Iberian world, the seminars consider how colonial subjects in the Iberian empires &ndash; including free black and indigenous American populations &ndash; shaped empire, religion, and science through daily practices and litigation. We explore how indigenous Americans and African Diaspora responded to the intellectual milieus of empire. Positioning such groups as intellectuals who shaped Iberian empires and the broader Atlantic world, this module analyzes their intellectual histories through an inter-disciplinary approach to works that they produced, including written traces in legal documents, religious treatises, contemporaneous histories, artifacts, art, and written correspondence.</p>

                              	<strong>Aims:</strong><br />
                              	This module provides an introduction to computer security concepts and techniques. It covers core security principles to engineer systems that provide properties like confidentiality, integrity or availability, despite the efforts of malicious entities to subvert them.<br />
                              	<br />
                              	<strong>Learning outcomes:</strong><br />
                              	Students will learn how to recognise security properties of systems, as well as formulate security policies, and model the threats they may face. Through exposure to a number of established industry and government security mechanisms and design patterns, they will be able to select appropriate controls to guarantee that the security policies are implemented robustly and may resist efforts to subvert them. Conversely, students will gain skills in analysing computer systems, and developing strategies to bypass security controls.<br />
                              	<br />
                              	<strong>Content:</strong><br />
                              	The first half of the course covers the basic principles, security policies, access control (theory and practice); hardware and OS security fundamentals which underpin security of systems. Then we dive into the details of various technical protection mechanisms and computer attacks including hardware, network and operating system security attacks; We learn about defensive technology in high-integrity systems. We study basic attacks in web security. We study user authentication and identification and how applied cryptography is used in TLS and network security. The module provides strong foundations in security engineering, and enables students to more easily follow other modules in Information Security and in Applied Cryptography.<br />

                              	<strong>Content:</strong>&nbsp; A broad-sweep survey across ten centuries of Greek literature starting from Homer and Hesiod in the eight century BC up to the Hellenistic Age of poetry and the Greek novel. All readings are in translation.<br />
                              	Topics included in this broad survey module vary slightly from year to year.&nbsp; Authors and genres covered may include the following: Homer; lyric poetry; Herodotus and Thucydides; Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides; Aristophanes; Plato and Aristotle; Hellenistic poetry; and ancient prose fiction. Twice weekly classes take as a starting point selected readings from major authors; the format is mixed lecture and discussion. The module will provide basic information and a chronological and thematic framework and is intended as an introduction to ancient Greek literature and theoretical approaches to literature. It will also introduce students to authors and genres of which they might not otherwise have experience. Students will be expected to equip themselves with specified translations of some works which are cheaply available in paperback; other texts will be supplied as handouts.</p>

It aims to introduce the principal characteristics of the genre in its various stages of development, and to locate love poetry within the wider social and literary contexts of first-century Rome. We shall see how Roman love poets respond to the historical and political situation of their time, and engage with contemporary attitudes to morality, gender and sexuality. Discussion of broader thematic issues will alternate with case studies of the works of particular poets, including Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus and Ovid. Attention will also be paid to the relationships between Latin love poetry and other literary genres, such as Roman comedy and epic.</p>

An Athenian writer, Xenophon travelled widely across the Greek world and Asia Minor, and wrote about his experiences with different cultures, both Greek and non-Greek. His texts discuss controversial issues of his day &ndash; conflict between Greeks, Spartan society and power, Persian imperialism, relations with foreign lands, and citizenly behaviour in Athens. Unlike most writers from his period, he wrote across a wide range of genres, such as history, philosophical dialogue and rhetoric, as well introducing new forms such as travel writing, biography and the novel. The module will examine a range of his texts, considering the relationship between cultural representation, politics and literary form, and addressing questions of Greek identity, concepts of Otherness, power relations and class consciousness in the context of the development of Classical Greek prose writing.</p>

It will provide key illustrations of different responses to classical cultures in action and demonstrate how later cultures have viewed and made use of the classical world from their own historically situated standpoint. It also aims to equip students with the tools for further research in the reception of the classical world by developing their critical and conceptual understanding in this field. The module is taught by a range of experts in classical reception. It addresses theory, the history of reception (from within antiquity to the twenty-first century, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean). The module also explores the engagements of classical antiquity throughout the centuries with issues of gender, class, race, politics and national identity.</p>
                              <p>
                              	In term 1, &lsquo;reception studies&rsquo;&nbsp;and its theoretical approaches are introduced. Case studies of reception are then explored within antiquity and beyond up to the Renaissance, with a focus mainly on literary reception. In term 2, case studies of reception are explored from the Renaissance up to the present day,&nbsp;with&nbsp;an emphasis on material culture, art, museums, performance, film and political thought (and includes tours of the Petrie and the British Museums). MA Reception students are required to take the whole module (40 credits). Other MA students may take the whole module or just term 1 as a half module.</p>

                              	<strong>Skills</strong>: By the end of the module, students will be expected to have acquired: (1) an understanding of different methodological approaches to studying the reception of the classical world, and an ability to implement those approaches in practice; (2) an awareness of the various historical and contextual factors (including religion, politics, gender and sexuality) that contribute to different receptions of classical cultures in different historical periods, different societies, and different media; and an understanding of how these factors might have affected responses to the classical world in any given case; (3) a knowledge of core research techniques (including use of bibliographical, archival and digital resources) for studying reception of the classical world, and an understanding of how these techniques can be applied to a range of materials; (4) a knowledge of different receptions of classical cultures over a range of historical periods, and an ability to analyse those responses critically from an historical and cultural perspective.</p>

                              	This module focuses on the many different ways in which publics engage with science in face-to-face contexts. Teaching will particularly focus on direct interactions within governance and policy settings, museums and other more informal activities, and on how specific public groups, such as patient and citizen groups get involved, and engage with, scientific and medical research. Group projects will develop a practical understanding of how to organize such activities, alongside which students will critically reflect on the theory and context that underpins such activities such as models of publics and audiences, rationales for engagement in different contexts and the wider policy contexts and historical trends.</p>

                              	An integrated module in molecular biology that is taught through lectures, tutorials and a laboratory-based experimental research project. The laboratory project and associated tutorials will introduces you to the processes of DNA cloning and DNA analyses. In the research component emphasis is placed on technical and numerical skills, scientific observation and data analyses. You will write your research project results in the form of a scientific paper and give an oral presentation to your tutor group. You will therefore gain experience in communicating scientific results and findings. To help you prepare for the practicals and exams there will be formative pre-practical quizzes and online bespoke exercises.</p>

                              	&ldquo;Quantitative Biology&rdquo; is designed to develop and/or enhance your skills in experimental design and data handling in a context appropriate for biological sciences. The module will cover data collection and processing and will be illustrated with a range of biological examples e.g., analysing the results of genetic crosses, investigating the prevalence of parasitic infections in insects, detecting skewed sex ratios and analysis of data collected from questionnaires.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                              <p>
                              	In addition to lectures, you will attend computer workshops and problem-based tutorials.&nbsp; In the workshops, you will apply statistical techniques that you have covered in the lectures to real world data sets. Tutorial problems will be released after each workshop and will address questions raised there.</p>
                              <p>
                              	By the end of this module, you will have a grasp on statistics which will allow you to interpret many of the findings reported in research papers. You will be able to apply these statistical skills in your own research right from the start of your undergraduate career (for example, the BIOL0005 Research project) and through to its end (for example, your 3rd/4th year research project)</p>
                              <p>
                              	A-level Maths is not a pre-requisite.

                              	This module examines major debates in the field of international security. Many important issues in international politics relate to the use or threat of military force and political violence, and the insecurity this threat poses to states, communities, and individuals. This module is organized into two parts. The first part will introduce students to key questions in the field of international security and the theoretical and empirical approaches scholars use to answer them, such as the causes of war, whether democracies are more peaceful than autocracies, and how international norms and institutions shape the behavior of states. The second part will examine a number of contemporary international security issues, including nuclear proliferation, civil conflict and terrorism, military intervention, and shifts in the global balance of power. Particular focus will be given to the research methods and empirical strategies commonly used by scholars in the field.</p>

                              	Science and technology permeate popular culture. From the film Black Panther to the Facebook page &lsquo;I F**king Love Science&rsquo;, science and popular culture are deeply intertwined. In this module we explore science in popular culture using theories from sociology, cultural studies, media studies and post-colonial studies. We will develop our skills as critical consumers of science in popular culture across different media and understand why thinking broadly matters. We&rsquo;ll watch films and TV programmes, we&rsquo;ll explore science on social media, we&rsquo;ll dissect skin cream adverts and we&rsquo;ll visit museums. We&rsquo;ll think too, about how popular culture influences science, such that science and popular culture may not be as separable as you might first think! Key themes of this module are 1) thinking about the relationships between producers and publics, 2) thinking about how science is represented (both in terms of <em>who </em>is represented and epistemology) and 3) thinking about science and popular culture in terms of dominant cultural practices. Key theories in this module are cultural consumption (and how this is affected by class, &lsquo;race&rsquo;/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability/disability and their intersections), communication theory, representation and social justice, post-colonial theory and theories about publics and participation.&rdquo;</p>

                              	This module examines the history of European colonialism in Sub-Saharan Africa from the late nineteenth century to the 1960s. It introduces a range of important debates on the nature of colonial rule, its impact on African societies and economies and its consequences for understanding contemporary Africa. Through a detailed analysis of a number of case studies, the module examines the diverse forms taken by colonialism and the unevenness of its political, economic and social effects. It engages with debates on the production of &lsquo;colonial knowledge&rsquo; and on the cultural dimensions of colonial rule and it examines the work of a range of African thinkers of the colonial period. Amongst other topics, we will examine the nature of colonial legal and political structures, the role of religion, the impact of European settlers, changing gender relations and the emergence of nationalist thinking.</div>

                              	This is an introductory module in the philosophy of science. The course is divided into two parts: (1) the epistemology of science and (2) the metaphysics of science. The first part of the course will focus on several central problems regarding the nature of scientific knowledge: how do scientists know if current scientific theories are true? Is science progressive? How do scientists test their theories and how are theories confirmed? Can science and pseudoscience be distinguished? How are sciences distinguished from one another? These questions will be discussed in the light of examples from science. During the course of discussing these problems, you will study some of the major positions that have been taken about scientific knowledge both in the history of philosophy and in the 20th century: Inductivism (Bacon), Logical Empiricism (Ayer and Quine), Falsificationism (Popper), Incommensurability (Kuhn) and Relativism (Feyerabend). What does it mean if more than two theories are consistent with the evidence (Quine/Duhem)? Philosophy of Science 1 will provide you with the background knowledge that you will need for other Philosophy courses that you will take in later years. You do not need prior knowledge of philosophy or science to do this course.</p>

                              	Through the lens of social and intellectual histories of empire in the Iberian world, the seminars consider how colonial subjects in the Iberian empires &ndash; including free black and indigenous American populations &ndash; shaped empire, religion, and science through daily practices and litigation. We explore how indigenous Americans and African Diaspora responded to the intellectual milieus of empire. Positioning such groups as intellectuals who shaped Iberian empires and the broader Atlantic world, this module analyzes their intellectual histories through an inter-disciplinary approach to works that they produced, including written traces in legal documents, religious treatises, contemporaneous histories, artifacts, art, and written correspondence.</p>

In this way, they will gain an understanding of concepts and theories produced by these sources. They will also concentrate on primary materials and develop the ability to read texts independently, to manage their own learning, to communicate ideas orally and in writing and to gather, analyze and synthesize data. Teamwork and independent thinking will also be strongly encouraged in order to enable student development and achievement.</p>

                              	Financial Accounting is concerned with accounting for the financial transactions and activities of a business in a particular financial period, and building the financial story of that period through the subsequent construction and publication of core financial statements: Balance Sheets, Income Statements, and Cash Flow Statements. In so doing it explains why profit and cash measurements of the same transactions and activities differ, and how Income Statements and Cash Flow Statements are constructed. The Accounting Equation of Assets = Liabilities is applied to the construction of the Balance Sheet. Contextually issues in revenue recognition and expense identification, and in the valuation of assets and liabilties are explored. The module shows students how to calculate financial ratios toanalyse and interpret the core financial statements to gain insights into financial health and performance, insights managers and other interested stakeholders, especially shareholders, are particularly interested in. The module also explores core aspects of Corporate Governanceand their implications for corporate reporting.</div>

This is an introductory course where students will learn the basics of environmental engineering sciences and the methods to analyse and manage environmental problems. In this course, we focus on five different environmental systems &iquest; air, energy, water, land and waste. Students will learn practical skills such as air quality assessment and visit environmental sites to learn how complex environmental problems are managed with a systems approach. Through guest lectures from academics and industry, students will also learn how theoretical knowledge can be applied in practice with case studies in particular environmental problems.</p>

                              	This module is for one-term only affilates. The Making of Modern America is an introduction to the key themes and events in twentieth century American history. Topics covered will include the New Deal, the impact of World War Two, US foreign policy during the Cold War and afterwards, the Civil Rights movements, the domestic impact of the war in Vietnam, the &ldquo;right turn&rdquo; of the 1970s and 1980s, and the Clinton, Bush II and Obama administrations. The lectures will focus on the competing visions of America that have shaped culture, society and politics since the 1920s and suggest some frameworks within which this history can be understood, while the seminars will explore a range of primary and secondary source material to help illuminate these themes.</p>

                              	The animal kingdom (Metazoa) is a vast grouping with over 1.3 million described species placed in 30-40 phyla that encompasses organisms as diverse as corals, worms and whales. This module will further your understanding of animal systematics and biology, in particular the evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) and biological diversity of animals, and how they are adapted to different environments. Due to the sheer size of the Metazoa we will focus on selected phyla, in order to obtain a broad understanding of the group but look at several groups in more detail, including arthropods and vertebrates.</p>

                              	This is a dedicated 15/20-credit MA module, offering a succinct and practical introduction to the Latin inscriptions of Roman antiquity. The module introduces students to both the practical study and the interpretation of a broad spectrum of Latin inscriptions, ranging in date from the archaic to the late Roman periods. This module is designed for those taking UCL MA/MSc degrees in the Institute of Archaeology, History, Medieval and Renaissance Studies, and the School of Languages and Cultures.</p>
                              <p>
                              	The module gives an overview of important skills for the use of inscriptions in historical, philological, and archaeological research and offers an introduction to both the practical techniques of recording, deciphering, and interpreting inscribed Latin texts and the techniques of editing and preparing epigraphic texts for publication. The main guides and resources for the practice of the discipline are introduced, and students learn how to use them. This module exploits the material in various collections in central London (the British Museum, University College London, and the Museum of London) to introduce students to a wide variety of examples of different types of inscriptions from various regions of the Roman world, drawn from an extensive chronological range, from the earliest inscriptions of the 8th century BC to the last phases of the significant use of inscriptions in civic life, in the 6th century AD.</p>

                              	This interdisciplinary module will examine the development of racial and ethnic thought, xenophobia, and related forms of exclusion in Africa from the nineteenth century to the present day. Among many topics, students in this module will examine the colonial construction of the &ldquo;native,&rdquo; intersections between race and gender under colonialism, and debates over autochthony and citizenship in postcolonial Africa. Students will also consider how new scholarship on race and slavery in Islamic Africa, racialization and sexuality under colonialism, and nativism in independent Africa is reshaping the field of African Studies. Questioning assumptions about Africa as a non-racialized space or a site of primordial ethnicity, this course will situate the study of ethnic and racial thought on the continent within broader scholarly debates across various disciplines.</p>

                              	This course offers students an overview of selective aspects of the history of twentieth-century London, set within the wider context of twentieth-century British history and politics, imperial history and decolonization. This is not a comprehensive and detailed history of the city itself; rather, London as a &lsquo;imperial metropole&rsquo; is used as a lens through which to explore broader questions about changing collective identities such as Englishness, Britishness, and the imperial. Case studies may include efforts to create &lsquo;imperial architecture&rsquo; in London c. 1900; intellectuals and imperialism in late Edwardian Bloomsbury; Americanisation in the 1920s &lsquo;jazz age&rsquo;; Cable Street and the anti-fascist struggle; the Blitz and its trans-Atlantic dimensions; and post-war &lsquo;New Commonwealth&rsquo; immigration in places such as Brixton and Notting Hill.</p>

                              	In his famous book <em>The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914&ndash;1991</em>, Eric Hobsbawm describes the disastrous failures of state communism, capitalism, and nationalism. Nowhere was the tragedy of the twentieth century more apparent than in the Balkans. What initiated as the dawn of an age of liberation from old Empires and catching up with the rest of the continent turned into a century of wars and violence between new nation states or within them coupled with their perpetual if not increased lagging behind the rest of Europe. This course will combine a chronological and thematic approach in order to explore the political, social, cultural and economic factors affecting such an outcome. It will look at foreign influence as well as domestic agency with the aim to unravel the great changes and lost opportunities of the recent dramatic history of the Balkans. Dominated as it was by conflict and oppression the twentieth century in the Balkans was also the time of great transformations and brilliant achievements of many Balkanites, whose trajectories will be illuminated both in lectures and reading.</p>

                              	1. to acquire a body of knowledge relating to the history of the Balkans in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including an understanding of key historiographical debates;</p>
                              <p>
                              	2. to develop a nuanced understanding of broader concepts and methodologies relevant to the study of history;</p>
                              <p>
                              	3. To develop a variety of analytic and research skills, including the structuring of complex arguments, the assessment of secondary literature and historiographical debates, primary source criticism, and map skills.</p>
                              <p>
                              	While the aim is to give the student a framework for understanding the totality of modern South-East European history and culture, students with an interest in a specific country will be able to set that subject against a broader Balkan (and European) background and submit coursework on their country of choice.</p>

                              	The role of voluntary organisations has been vital to social and political life throughout the history of modern Britain. Across the fields of social welfare, health, education/youth work, international development and humanitarian aid, non-governmental organisations have made significant contributions. The module introduces students to the latest research and debates, exploring change from challenges to Victorian and Edwardian models of philanthropy during and after the First World War to the age of the big international NGO in the 1980s. It highlights the importance of voluntary action for ordinary people &ndash; particularly women and young people &ndash; across the twentieth century, and promotes an enhanced understanding of the voluntary sector today. Drawing extensively on primary source material, the module is taught through 10 activity-based seminars. In particular, students are introduced to the material culture of charity in the past through object-based learning (OBL) and assessment includes writing an &lsquo;object report&rsquo; as well as a standard essay.</p>

                              	An exploration of ethical challenges arising in recent scientific activity. Some challenges will focus on the results of research. Others will concern the process of research itself and science&#39;s efforts at self-regulation. This is a practical, issues-based course. Emphasis also will be on current events and fundamental principles.</p>

                              	This module is designed to analyse and question the recurring argument in modern society which claims that science and religion are and have always been in conflict with one another. The belief that there are fundamental and irreconcilable differences between these two systems and the ways they view the world actually has a much more recent history than is generally assumed, arising primarily out of the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries. This module explores the ways in which people in different cultures and different time periods have attempted to navigate between naturalistic and faith-based understandings of the world we inhabit. We will look at several cultures including the Christian, Islamic and Chinese traditions, as well as various themes such as cosmology, Darwinism and medicine.</p>

                              	This module provides an overview of the development of the sciences from 1800 to the present, with particular emphasis on the twentieth century. The development of science will be considered in its social, political and cultural contexts. Topics include science in different national contexts (Germany, United States, Soviet Union), science and war (Second World War and Cold War), the emergence of new specialties and disciplines (such as geology, quantum physics, psychology, relativity, genetics, particle physics) as well as the development of older ones, and major intellectual and social themes (the discovery of deep time, evolution, diversity in science). Emphasis will be on the physical and life sciences.</div>

                              	In the past decades, increasing recognition has been given to the Jewish origins of Christianity and the Jewish context in which Christianity was formed. The scope and implications of this topic are wide. This module will restrict itself to the following, specific objectives: Firstly, to assess the nature of Judaism and Jewish life in the period when Christianity arose. This will involve the study of various Jewish groups that were active in this period, such as Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, as well as the study of post-Biblical Jewish literature including the Dead Sea scrolls. Students will gain an appreciation of the complexity of Judaism and its importance in ancient society. Secondly, to assess the nature of early Christianity in relation to Judaism, and to discuss whether, when, and how, Christianity &#39;parted ways&#39; from Judaism. Particular attention will be given to Jesus, Paul, and their successors&#39; attitudes to the Jewish people, Jewish law, and Judaism. Thirdly, to consider Jewish-Christian relations, Christian attitudes to Judaism, and Jewish attitudes to Christianity, in the first few centuries of the Common Era. Admission to this module is open to students of all backgrounds and disciplines. All texts will be studied in translation.</div>

                              	Saints were the celebrities of medieval Europe. From the miracles they worked to the rituals and journeys they inspired, holy bodies were invested with immense spiritual and political power. Relics were also hugely important as a source of aesthetic inspiration. This module explores art and architecture associated with physical remains of saints. Focusing especially on three cult sites in the Middle Ages - Jerusalem, Santiago de Compostela and Canterbury - we will see how imagery associated with saintly bodies adapts and morphs to suit the needs of different times and places. Looking at this imagery through the prism of categories such as translation, liminality, the simulacrum and the souvenir, the module asks how modern critical frameworks can reconnect us with the potency of the relic. As well as considering reliquaries and cult statues, we will explore such phenomena as mappaemundi or world maps, virtual or armchair pilgrimage, and replica buildings designed to &#39;translate&#39; sites associated with the Holy Land from East to West. At the end of the module we will also consider the afterlife of the relic. Why, in some parts of Europe, did the power of saintly remains seemingly diminish? Where and how has it re-emerged?</div>

                              	What happens during sleep? Why do we dream? Across the centuries there have been many attempts to answer these and other questions surrounding the still-mysterious state of sleep. This course is designed to explore the different ways sleeping and dreaming have been understood in the past, both distant and recent. What is the relation between the physical and mental aspects of sleep; why do some cultures see dreams as true, some see them as false, and other see them as the gateway to the unconscious? We discuss historical understandings of the physiology of sleep, the interpretations of dreams, the material culture of resting, the drugs that produce artificial sleep, and the ways sleeping and dreaming have been used in art, literature and film. The module is designed to familiarise students with the questions and literature in the history of sleep, including medical and psychological materials. The class will follow a seminar-based model, requiring students to read the materials critically and discuss the materials in class. As an advanced course, it is also intended to increase the student&rsquo;s analytical, research and writing skills. The research essay requires students to gather the primary and secondary literature on a topic, synthesise the material and hone their abilities at making a sustained argument.</p>

                              	This module provides an understanding of key issues and applied methodologies relating to management accounting frameworks used by managers when faced with making financial decisions in the context of the business environment. The focus is on information for cost management, budgetary control, and short and longer term financial decision making. That information enables managers to plan for and subsequently control operations. It examines the blend of financial analysis and managerial judgment required to make sound decisions. In particular there is an emphasis on issues in overhead cost recovery; contribution costing and CVP analysis; costing issues in the context of a competitive environment, including activity based costing (ABC); relevant costs for decision making; core investment appraisal techniques (ARR, Payback, NPV and IRR); budgetary control, variance analysis, standard costing.</p>

                              	The &#39;West&#39; has long occupied a privileged place in U.S. geopolitics. Since the first decades of the nineteenth century, this region has heralded both the success and demise of the American experiment. This module considers the ways in which American visual culture (painting, photography, film, and city planning) has pictured, produced, critiqued and mythologized this geography. Central to our discussion of the spatial politics of empire building will be the particular importance of the figure of the &#39;frontier&#39; in American geopolitics. Why, we will ask, has the American frontier remained open-ended and ill-defined for the last two centuries? Does it mark a specific place? Is it a figure of modernity? As will become evident throughout the module, these questions were as central to the formation of the nation as they are today. Topics for discussion will include the organization of the US border with Mexico, immigration, land rights and gun control.</div>

                              	This module explores the history of humanity&rsquo;s changing conceptions of the universe, from the ancient world to the current day. Issues examined will include the origins and development of astronomy, theories of the origin of the universe and of the nature of the universe, ideas of humanity&rsquo;s place in the cosmos. The overall aim of the module is to give a working knowledge of astronomy and cosmology from the Babylonians to the present. The course is divided into two roughly equal elements: (a) ancient and classical astronomy and cosmology to Einstein, and (b) modern astronomy and cosmology after Einstein. The course will rasie historical, technical and philosophical questions. By the end of the course students will have acquired: (1) A working knowledge of the history of astronomy and cosmology, (2) An appreciation of the development of views on the nature of space and time, (3) An appreciation of debates about man&rsquo;s place in the cosmos, (4) A basic technical knowledge of major ancient and modern theories, and (5) A knowledge of the philosophical principles underpinning cosmology and cosmogony.</p>

                              	How can we, and how should we, write the history of sex and sexuality? How did the experiences of men or women who experienced sexual desire for members of the same sex change over the course of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries? When did the idea of a homosexual, gay, lesbian, or queer identity appear in Britain? What was the role of legal changes (all homosexual acts between men in public or private were criminalised between 1885 and 1967) and of scientific knowledge in shaping identities and practices? These are the questions this module sets out to answer. It looks at legal changes relating to homosexuality and the development of scientific thinking on the subject. It also looks at changing queer subcultures, sexual practices, and sexual identities in Britain from the 1880s to the 1980s, asking how sexual practices related to sexual identities, and charting the development of self-conscious and proud LGBTQ+ identities.</p>

                              	This module will examine how ideas about development help us understand the various ways the world is divided into rich and poor. We will critically examine the idea that the world can be understood as composed of the rich, industrialised &ldquo;developed&rdquo; countries (or global &ldquo;North&rdquo;) and the poorer &ldquo;majority world&rdquo; (or global &ldquo;South&rdquo;), and &ndash; using a critical approach to the processes of development &ndash; we will emphasize the interaction of politics with society, culture and economics.</div>

                              	This module deals with the empirical reality, theory, and current governance problems of development, poverty, and inequality. Specifically, throughout the course we will investigate the influence of colonialism, state capacity, regime type, war and conflict, accountability, social structures (ethnicity and gender), and corruption on economic development. This module engages with both economic theory regarding development and political science research that highlights the challenges to implementing the policies that would lead to economic development. The main objective of the moudle is to introduce students to the main debates in the political economic of development field and the various strategies to promote development. Over the duration of the module, students will learn to critically apply different theoretical perspectives on development to a range of contemporary substantive issues that are relevant to international public policy and development.</div>

We will then focus on the role of institutions and policy in promoting and hindering economic development. The module will then explore the relationship between ethnic diversity and gender and economic development and the ways in which war and development influence each other. The last two weeks of the module will then investigate the role of aid and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in promoting economic development.</div>

                              	This module examines the interplay between values and social sciences. It asks both how the social sciences are or should be influenced by values and how moral or political philosophy should incorporate the findings of the social sciences. The course has two overall aims: first, to encourage critical reflection on the methodology of the social sciences and, second, to explore the relationship between normative philosophy and the social sciences.</div>

                              	This module will address questions including: Are the social sciences inevitably more value-laden than the natural sciences? Should citizens decide what gets researched? Can there be moral reasons for social scientists to refrain from researching particular topics or communicating their results? What can and should moral and political philosophy learn from the social sciences? What should the relation between political philosophy and political science be like?</div>

                              	The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a time of economic change, intellectual development and political conflict in the Balkans, in which the Ottoman Empire experienced pressure from internal and external threats, and the Balkan peoples responded to the changing local, regional and international environment. This module combines a chronological and thematic approach, exploring the social, cultural, economic and political transformations of the period. While the break-up of empires and the establishment of national states claiming to represent the Balkan nations is an important aspect of this story, the module also seeks to challenge a teleological narrative that assumes that nations and nationalism were always the most important categories of social and political life in the region.</p>

                              	There are three mutually interrelated aims of the course:</p>
                              <p>
                              	1. to acquire a body of knowledge relating to the history of the Balkans in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including an understanding of key historiographical debates;</p>
                              <p>
                              	2. to develop a nuanced understanding of broader concepts and methodologies relevant to the study of history;</p>
                              <p>
                              	3. To develop a variety of analytic and research skills, including the structuring of complex arguments, the assessment of secondary literature and historiographical debates, primary source criticism, and map skills.</p>
                              <p>
                              	While the aim is to give the student a framework for understanding the totality of modern South-East European history and culture, students with an interest in a specific country will be able to set that subject against a broader Balkan (and European) background and submit coursework on their country of choice.</p>

                              	Greek religion is a complex topic of abiding fascination. This module starts by addressing the questions of what (Greek) religion is and how religious practices and beliefs in ancient Greece differed from (but are also similar to) contemporary forms of monotheism. We will explore the various and conflicting ways in which the Greeks imagined their gods, with a special emphasis on genre and setting: we&rsquo;ll consider the anthropomorphic divinities of Homer, Hesiod, and Greek tragedy; the rather more abstract deities of the philosophers; and the gods invoked in magic and mystery religions. The second main focus of the course will be on the religion of the Greek city-state of the classical period and its various aspects, such as priesthoods and sacrifices, sanctuaries and festivals, channels of communication with the divine sphere (seers, oracles, dreams), and hero cult. We&rsquo;ll end with a look at a religious phenomenon that emerged during the Hellenistic Age: the deification of the king.</p>

                              	The unifying topic of &ldquo;Introduction to Human Genetics&rdquo; is how genes and their interactions, either with other genes or with the environment, make us what we are. When these interactions break down genetic disease may result, and it is often through these genetic mistakes that we are able to work out what happens in the normal situation. The module will introduce you to the subject of human genetics, enable you to appreciate the implications of genetic research for society and provide a basis for more advanced studies.&nbsp;At the end of the module, you should be able to understand and critically evaluate scientific studies in human genetics, whether reported in scientific journals or in the lay press.</p>
                              <p>
                              	The introductory lectures will remind you how Mendelian rules of inheritance can be applied to human families but that this is not always straightforward to interpret. Not all traits are inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion and the methods by which quantitative and multifactorial traits are studied will be introduced in the second half of the course.</p>
                              <p>
                              	The lectures on pedigrees are followed by a section on cytogenetics that covers the study of chromosomes and their abnormalities, followed by lectures on molecular genetics. The module continues with the study of inborn errors of metabolism and with the nature and origin of human genetic variation.</p>
                              <p>
                              	The second half of the module focuses on genetic mapping techniques which culminated in the multi-billion dollar human genome project. Within these lectures we examine gene mapping tools for both monogenic and polygenic diseases with examples that are interesting both for their own sake but also as examples of the results obtained using the molecular methods discussed earlier.&nbsp; The human genome project has now moved on from the study of the human DNA sequence to the study of variation between individuals and populations. The existence of genetic variation, polymorphism, has been known for many years and we look at this both from a historical perspective as well as considering how this is of interest to modern genetics, medicine and to the pharmaceutical industry. The module will cover the study of human populations and human origins and it will include discussions on the topic of bioethics through a debate.</p>

                              	Professional roles in pharmacy have evolved in recent years and continue to become even more patient-focussed. Pharmacists are the medicines experts within the health care system and this module provides a range of learning opportunities to prepare students for this crucial responsibility. This module further develops the eight aspects already addressed throughout the degree &ndash; professionalism, legislation, supply of medicines, governance, public health, medicine safety, communication skills and transferable skills. Each aspect builds on what has already been covered at a level which prepares the student for pre-registration practice. This module aims to describe current and future roles in pharmacy and prepare the students for practice. Complex patients and complex situations are explored, with attention to evidence-based practice, ethical issues and professionalism.</p>

                              	&ldquo;Life on Earth&rdquo; will begin by discussing the evidence for the emergence of life, the origins of the solar system and the conditions under which life emerged and the origin of eukaryotic cells. The theory behind reconstructing trees of evolutionary relatedness will be introduced and patterns of relatedness in the living world discussed, ranging from familiar creatures to new and bizarre forms being discovered in the depths of the oceans and under the earth&rsquo;s surface. All main branches of life will be covered with a particular focus on the evolution of plants and their importance to global biodiversity and on the many groups of invertebrates and vertebrates including ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                              	In addition to lectures you will attend practical sessions in the Grant Museum of Zoology. At the end of the module you should be familiar with the diversity of living organisms; with classification of the living world; with the origins and history of life; and with the fundamental body plans of major groups of animals. You will have a solid grounding in modern ideas of the history of evolution of life on earth and understand the link between the evolution of developmental processes and the evolution of adult morphology.</p>

                              	The purpose of PHAY 0012 is to learn about the clinical importance of the formulation sciences and pharmaceutical processing.&nbsp; Clinically registered medicines will be used to exemplify concepts. To have impact, the formulation sciences requires knowledge of the clinical end point.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p>
                              	Pharmaceutical Biotechnology is covered during semester 1. Therapeutic proteins, polypeptides and vaccines have become widely, and in many cases routinely used since the advent of the biotechnology era (ca 1980). The vast majority of these medicines require parenteral administration. The non-covalent interactions of therapeutic proteins define a tertiary (3-dimensional) structure which must be maintained to be biologically active.</p>
                              <p>
                              	Maintaining the tertiary structure throughout the manufacture, formulation, transport, storage and use of therapeutic proteins is often difficult. Because parenteral administration is necessary, clearance is also often rapid and must be optimised. The pharmaceutical sciences are critical for transforming biotechnologically derived actives into viable and prac&shy;tical medicines.</p>
                              <p>
                              	During Semester 2 we will examine other important facets of the formulation sciences. Complex formulations of low molecular weight actives or in some cases, actives that do not have a defined structure have been developed. Often these actives are poorly soluble, but one important consideration is these actives are often characterised by a narrow therapeutic window. Again the pharmaceutical sciences are critical in transforming such actives into useful medicines and while more traditional dosage forms continue to be developed, the use of drug eluting, implantable dosage forms, e.g. microspheres or injectable implants is also important to improve efficacy and patient compliance. During Semester 2 of the module there will be considerable emphasis on clinical pharmaceutics where clinically registered medicines will be used as examples to illustrate how the pharmaceutical sciences can influence clinical outcome. An emphasis of the importance of clinical pharmaceutics provides the framework to show how knowledge of the underlying science of medicines is important in the day-to-day provision and use of medicines. We will also discuss the development of generic medicines in the context of protein therapeutics, complex formulations and narrow therapeutic index drugs.</p>
                              <p>
                              	Another general topic of this module relates to how new medicines and treatments are evolving. There is much more awareness about the need to ensure there is widespread access for both improved versions of existing medicines and new medicines. The pharmaceutical sciences can contribute to the increased access of medicines by making medicines more cost-effective and more practical to use (e.g. provision of ready to use dosage forms, no need for a cold chain). The pharmaceutical sciences play an important part in the lifecycle management of medicines. Life cycle management seeks to increase patient benefit, often by developing an improved version of a medicine that may be easier to administer or has a longer duration of action.&nbsp; As exemplified in the coursework and in some of the lectures, the need to consider a holistic perspective about healthcare will be encouraged.</p>

                              	What are the origins of modern medicine? How did people experience disease in the past? This course addresses the changes and developments in Western medicine from the Ancient Greek world to 1700. We will discuss ancient, medieval and early modern understandings of the body and llness, the varieties of theory and practice of medicine, and the historical background to premodern medicine. Among the themes we will pursue are the rise of hospitals, developments in anatomy and physiology, religion and medicine, contagious diseases, and changes in pharmacology.</p>

                              	Systematic reviews use robust methods to identify and examine existing research reports on a given topic and to produce accessible, reliable and useful syntheses or maps of research, often for policy or practice audiences. Students will learn the principles underlying all systematic reviews, and the ways that they vary &ndash; from different types of research question through to methods for synthesising both quantitative and qualitative findings. Students will apply tools that aid review production and apply methods to formulate review questions, identify research, classify and appraise studies, and plan syntheses of findings. They will apply their learning so as to critically appraise existing review reports. Students participate in workshops in a classroom at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE) or at a distance via Moodle, our virtual learning environment. Workshops will be recorded and made available on Moodle. All students will be expected to engage in additional individual and group activities online.</p>

                              	This course is a continuation of HPSC0004 Philosophy of Science, intended for students that have completed that course or studied a similar introduction to philosophy of science elsewhere. The course explores some central debates in general philosophy of science, including: arguments, realism and antirealism about scientific theories, scientific explanation, laws of nature, reductionism and the unity of science. After this course you should possess a fairly well-rounded view of the field, as well as a set of skills that will allow you to work further on your own.</p>

                              	This course explores topics in the philosophy of the natural sciences. In the philosophy of physics, we will address how quantum mechanics has changed our view of physical reality; and how particle physics has had an impact on philosophical debates about realism and antirealism in science, such as recent literature on structural realism. We will interrogate the philosophical literature on mechanisms and causality by considering astrophysical mechanisms. In the philosophy of chemistry, we will assess the periodic table as a system of classification and particular philosophical problems presented by molecular structure and shape and biomolecular visualisation. We will also discuss problems common to both physics and chemistry such as problems of data, simulation and modelling.</p>

                              	This module aims explore the relationships between science, war and the prevention of war.&nbsp; It will place military and security technologies within social, political, and historical contexts.&nbsp; There is particular emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and on weapons usually designated as `unconventional&rsquo; or `weapons of mass destruction&rsquo;. In addition to thinking about how science, technology and warfare have shaped each other, this module also considers the changing role of the scientist in relation to the state, and considers broader themes such as the arms control, disarmament, ethics, and popular culture in relation to war. Students attend one 2 hour lecture seminar per week.</p>

        [OAuth 2 (Open Authorization)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) is
        an open standard for access delegation. It is used for token-based
        authentication and authorization. 

        This standard is used by many technology providers, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter. By using OAuth 2, it is possible to grant access to a secured resource (with an access token) for a specific period of time. Once the lifetime of that access token expires, the consumer has to refresh the token to obtain a new token.

        After [subscribing to an API](http://usermanual-not-exist) using self service portal in the api platform, consumers need to generate an access token to invoke the API. This is an OAuth2 access token. The validity period of this access token can be specified when generating it.


        Authenticating via OAuth requires the following steps:

        1. Create a Client

        2. Generate a Token

        3. Make Authenticated Requests


        ### Create a Client

        You must first register your applicaion using slef service API platform, contact API platform team for more detail. This is a one-time operation. You will be provided with a Client ID and a Client Secret key. Please note this information down, as it will be required for the next step.


        **Note:** The OAuth client will be owned by a user account used to login to create client id in first place. If you want to perform PUT, POST, or DELETE operations using the OAuth client, the owner of the OAuth client must have a Platform role that includes the "API Write Access" permission.


        ### Generate a Token

        To obtain a token, an app sends the client ID and client secret associated with it to token api. If these parameters (i.e. client ID and client secret) are valid, an access token will be returned back. 


        Token api requires the following parameters:

        - `client_id` - obtain from the previous step

        - `client_secret` - obtain from the previous step

        - `grant_type` - must be set to `client_credentials`


        For example, the following cURL command can be used to access the Token API.

               curl -k -d "grant_type=client_credentials" -H "Authorization: Basic cEJ6dUlaaEdwaGZRbWRjVVgwbG5lRmlpdXh3YTo0U0pnV19qTU56aGpIU284OGJuZVhtTnFNMjRh" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://localhost:8243/token -v

        NOTE: Combine the consumer key and consumer secret keys in the format consumer-key:consumer-secret and encode the combined string using [base64](http://base64encode.org).


        You receive a response similar to the following:

              {
                "access_token":"4c27f899-6f9c-3217-b974-3ceb5a409ac3",
                "scope":"am_application_scope default",
                "token_type":"Bearer",
                "expires_in":723
              }


        ### Make Authenticated Requests

        Every API requests must include a valid authentication token in an HTTP header:

        `Authorization: Bearer {bearer_token}`


        ### Refresh Token

        An access token is issued with a limited lifetime, An hour most of the time. Therefore, when the lifetime is over, the token will expire. Afterward, users/client apps need a new token to consume the secured services. This can be addressed using token api with the following parameters.


        - `client_id` - obtain from the previous step

        - `client_secret` - obtain from the previous step

        - `grant_type` - must be set to `refresh_token`

        - 'refresh_token' - retoken obtain from the previous access token api call


        For example, the following cURL command can be used to refresh the token.

              curl -k -d "grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=<retoken>" -H "Authorization: Basic SVpzSWk2SERiQjVlOFZLZFpBblVpX2ZaM2Y4YTpHbTBiSjZvV1Y4ZkM1T1FMTGxDNmpzbEFDVzhh" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://localhost:8243/token

         
        NOTE: Combine the consumer key and consumer secret keys in the format consumer-key:consumer-secret and encode the combined string using [base64](http://base64encode.org).


        You receive a response similar to the following:

              {
                  "scope":"default",
                  "token_type":"Bearer",
